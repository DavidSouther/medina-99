**Clue 2: Increase in Alien Technology**
As the smuggling operations expand, more and more alien technology starts popping up in the marketplace. Some of these items, while seemingly harmless, have unique properties or rare components that aren't known to commonly be available in Medina-99. This influx of alien technology could point investigators towards broader operations involving alien criminals.

**Clue 3: The Uncommon Psychoactive Substances**
These substances are not native to the Sol system, providing another clue to the players about the extent of the smuggling operation. Local law enforcement and medical professionals begin to report cases of citizens affected by this alien substance in strange ways --based on symptoms, this is clearly not a common Earth-origin drug.

**Clue 4: Zukor's Misdirection**
If the players pay attention, they might notice a pattern in Zukor's investigations always leading away from where the action is. While Zukor is genuinely trying to solve the cases, his dogged pursuit of incomplete leads is questionable. The heroes might start investigating why he's always leading them astray.

**Clue 5: Increase in Intimidation and Obscure Threats**
As Graxx and Klynn push to maintain control over their operation, there will be an uptick in obscure threats and intimidation against potential competitors and anyone who gets too close to the truth. This shows in increased 'accidental' systems failures, threats disguised as freak accidents to those snooping too close, and a general atmosphere of fear among those in the know.

In conclusion, if the players are observant, they will be led to unravel the complex web of this smuggling operation and reveal the major players behind it.
