  Describe several of the locations in more detail.
---
**1. Detectives’ Office:** Located on the Z+ Habitation Ring, the detectives' office is a juxtaposition of high-tech and charmingly outdated decor. Multiple screens display feeds from across the station, maps, and case files, while pinboard walls are covered with notes, photographic evidence, and colorful yarn linking various elements of ongoing cases. There are comfortable seating areas for witness interviews, a small holographic conference table, an encrypted case archive, and a corner reserved for the detectives' personal desks – one meticulously tidy, the other cluttered but homely.

**2. Mistress Zephira’s Hidden Lair:** Deep within the underbelly of Medina-99, accessible only through a maze of barely-used service passages, lies Zephira's hidden lair. It's a tech heaven, filled with sophisticated equipment, huge data screens, and a multitude of processing units. The room, bathed in a cool, blue glow, holds an air of intense focus. 

**3. Medina Marketplace:** A bustling, vibrant marketplace teeming with aliens and humans alike. The air is filled with the aroma of exotic foods, the chatter of a hundred languages, and the hum of alien tech. Stalls selling everything from rare space artifacts to high-tech gadgets line the busy thoroughfares, where shoppers haggle fiercely.

**4. Stellar Drift Space Bar:** A well-loved stopover for weary travelers and residents alike, the Stellar Drift is a blend of retro space design with modern lounging comfort. Low light, quiet alien jazz, and tables with a range of gravitational settings cater to diverse clientele. Shi' Karra, the owner, is ever-present, serving drinks, sharing stories, and maintaining a warm, inviting atmosphere.

**5. Interstellar Corporate District:** A collection of sleek skyscrapers, each a maze of offices and meeting rooms. Here, corporate executives, interstellar traders, and diplomats negotiate deals and discuss policies. It's a beautifully fabricated illusion of glass and metal, hiding the cutthroat world beneath its shiny surface.

**6. The Holo-Garden:** One of Medina-99's unique relaxation zones, the Holo-Garden can morph into any landscape requested by the visitors, from serene alien meadows under two moons to teeming Earth jungles. Amidst the bustle and metallic monotony of the rest of the station, it provides a much-needed oasis of calm and connection to nature.
