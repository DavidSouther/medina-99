  4. **The Smoke Screen** - Misinformation or a complex alibi is created,
  designed to obfuscate the truth and confuse law enforcement.
---
True to her devious nature, Mistress Zephira unleashes a torrent of distractions to obfuscate her real scheme. She employs multiple tactics to throw law enforcement off her trail:

**Virtual Decoys:** She unleashes a swarm of cyber decoys -- minor cyber attacks on various non-critical systems. Each one is designed to mimic her unique encryption signature, giving the impression that she's attacking multiple targets simultaneously.

**Social Unrest:** Using her distorted info dump, she incites instable groups within the station populace, sparking small-scale protests and public unrest. The law enforcement resources are divided to maintain peace, providing her more leeway for her cyber operations.

**False Hacker Identity:** Zephira creates and 'leaks' evidence suggesting a notorious, but entirely fictional rogue hacker in the outer systems, is behind the cyber attacks. This misdirection could occupy precious days or even weeks of the investigative resources.

**Alibi Projection:** She inserts encrypted data chunks within the information outflow of seemingly unrelated entities, like an alien cultural exchange program or deep-space research missions, to create an alibi connection for her activities, suggesting a larger, trans-system conspiracy.

Meanwhile, our detectives would need to navigate this smokescreen, discerning valuable clues from the haze of misinformation, wary of the fact they're dealing with a deceptive and strategic criminal mastermind.
