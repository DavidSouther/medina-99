  3. **The Stakeout** - The criminal watches and waits, looking for the perfect
  moment to strike again.
---
As the plans for their major cyber assault are finalized, Mistress Zephira and her team transition into a state of careful vigilance. They are like prowling predators, intimately familiar with their prey, watching patiently for the opportune moment to pounce. 

From their hidden digital lairs, they monitor the system defenses closely. They track the movements and activities of the corporations, law enforcement, and even our detectives. They look for patterns, waiting for that brief window of opportunity when defenses might be lowered, or distraction might offer them an opening.

In particular, Zephira is seeking a moment of high drama or tension on Medina-99 as the perfect cover for her crime. It could be during a major social event, a high-profile interstellar meeting, or even in the aftermath of an engineered distraction.

All the while, our detectives are conducting their own stakeout, keeping an eye on the cyber landscape of Medina-99 and carefully studying the patterns of the past breaches, hoping to get a jump on the criminals. Little do they realize, however, how closely they themselves are being watched by Zephira.
