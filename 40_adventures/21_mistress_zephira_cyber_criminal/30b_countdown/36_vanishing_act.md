  6. **The Vanishing Act** - The criminal attempts to disappear, leaving behind
  a cold trail as they enact their final plan.
---
Having executed her major data theft and set the corporations reeling, Mistress Zephira enacts her final step, making herself disappear.

She initiates a sophisticated data-wiping protocol that erases all her digital footprints from the systems she infiltrated, as well as deleting their own physical and digital identities off the radius of Medina-99. Any alias or identifying coding signature connected to her or her team is scrubbed clean. Her darknet hideouts and virtual meeting points are abandoned and digitally 'burned down'.

Simultaneously, she triggers a cascading system failure across the station's non-essential systems, creating a digital wildfire that furthers erases any remnants of her illicit activities and making the system administrators scramble to keep critical services running, distracting them from pursuing her digital ghost.

In the physical world, Zephira and her team abandon their secret hideouts on Medina-99, using the chaos resulting from their cyber-attack and the public unrest she fueled earlier as cover. They blend into the crowds, shed their current identities, and exit the station via discreet routes, effectively vanishing without a trace.

Even as the detectives sift through the aftermath of the corporate data breaches and deal with the resulting chaos, they find the trail of Mistress Zephira going cold – a puzzling ghost story in the heart of Medina-99, leaving them with a cryptic puzzle to unravel.
