  5. **The Alibi** - As the net closes in, the criminal enacts their cover
  story, establishing an alibi that seems ironclad.
---
With the detectives closing in and her plans for the massive data theft set to launch, Zephira decides to solidify her alibi. For this, she employs one of her trusted accomplices, Silence. 

Silence, a dedicated member of her hacker cell, is known for their ability to mimic Zephira's hacking style impeccably. Using this talent, Silence stages an elaborate virtual duel between the security systems of an offshore gambling network and a 'malicious hacker' at a time Zephira has chosen for her major data heist from the corporations. 

Simultaneously, Zephira establishes a physical alibi by planting evidence suggesting she is off-station at the time due to a private medical treatment. She hacks into the station's medical unit logs, creating an entry for herself undergoing a critical treatment which cannot be interrupted, thus convincingly placing herself away from the scene of the crime.

Blinded by the vivid duel between Silence and the gambling network, and with evidence placing Zephira elsewhere during the crime, the detectives might be led to believe that Zephira is not behind the corporate data theft, giving her the perfect cover to carry out her plan.
