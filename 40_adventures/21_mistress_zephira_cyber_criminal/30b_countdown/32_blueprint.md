  2. **The Blueprint** - Plans and preparations for the next phase of the crime
  are made, more complex and daring than the first.
---
Riding the wave of their initial successes, Zephira and her team start to put together the blueprint for their main operation. The smaller attacks served to test the defenses of Medina-99 and provided data regarding its security infrastructure. Now, they're preparing to strike where it hurts most - the databases of the major corporations on the station.

In the shadows of Medina-99's network, they're honing their malware, continuously evolving it to bypass or disrupt the updated security measures. They are aiming to siphon off sensitive data without triggering alarms. They are methodically planning their actions, mapping out the steps to infiltrate the tightly guarded servers of the interstellar corporations.

Meanwhile, our detectives, suspecting a major cyber attack, begin to work with the corporations to fortify the security systems. They are on high alert, watching for any sign of a large-scale breach and trying to anticipate where the blow will fall. Unbeknownst to them, Zephira's blueprint is nearing completion, and she's about to make her next move.
