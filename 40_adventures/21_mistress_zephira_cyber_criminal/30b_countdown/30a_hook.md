  They've already done something leading up to the plan, which left a clue. What
  clue did they leave behind to hook the players into investigating their plot?
---
The initial clue left behind by Mistress Zephira and her team is an anomalous data file found in one of the minor system infrastructures of the Medina-99 station, a system which handles mundane logistics like supply order inputs for station maintenance.

Inadvertently exposed during a low-level data breach – which was resolved as a routine cyber-security event – this file seems initially insignificant, but it has a strange encryption signature that doesn't match any known systems on the station. To a casual observer, it could appear as nothing more than random data corruption. 

However, our tech-savvy Detective Blair Cameron, always curious about interesting anomalies, notices something peculiar about the encryption sequence. It contains patterns resonating with criminal cyber activities encountered earlier in their career. The encryption method used is rare and sophisticated, suggesting that this wasn't a casual or arbitrary hacker, but someone with a definite motive and skill.

This unusual find sparks intrigue and spurs our detectives into investigating further, tugging at the loose thread that will eventually unravel Mistress Zephira's grand scheme.
