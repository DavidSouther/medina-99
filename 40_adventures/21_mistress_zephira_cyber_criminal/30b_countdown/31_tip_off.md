  1. **The Tip-Off** - Early evidence of the crime surfaces, a clue that hints
  at a larger scheme.
---
As the detectives delve into the mystery of the strange encrypted data they stumbled upon, they start to notice a slow but consistent stream of minor cyber breaches across Medina-99. Public-facing and peripheral systems are targeted, like digital billboards displaying gibberish for split seconds, automatic doors malfunctioning sporadically, or comms receiving static-filled messages. Each incident in itself seems like a random glitch, but together they create a pattern hinting at a larger scheme.

In this phase of the crime, Zephira and her accomplices are testing the security systems of Medina-99, probing for vulnerabilities, and mapping out the cyber landscape. To the seasoned eyes of our detectives, however, these actions trigger an alarm; they realise that these seemingly random incidents might be precursors to a more significant cyber threat, leading them to prepare for a potential high-scale cyber-attack. The race to prevent it before it happens begins.
