  Who are additional parties who are uninterested in the crime, but who the
  players could turn to for help?
---
There are several individuals and groups within the sprawling Medina-99 space station who may not be primarily interested in Zephira's crimes, yet they might still prove helpful to our detectives:

**1. Ikto, the Alien Merchant:** An old fixture in the Medina-99 marketplace, Ikto is a non-human merchant with an uncanny knowledge of what's happening on the station. He may be largely indifferent to politics or corporate maneuverings, but his extensive network of contacts and sources could provide invaluable information. (Level – Mook, Attributes - 0 in Robotics & Law, Aspect - "Helpful Alien Informant", Basic Skill - Alien Culture and Psychology)

**2. The Freewheelers:** A loosely-affiliated group of space cowboys, smugglers, and free traders who operate in the vicinity of Medina-99. While typically detached from political intrigue, they have a broad range of contacts and might provide unexpected aid or information, for the right price.

**3. Shi’ Karra,  the Space Bar Owner:** The proprietor of the 'Stellar Drift', a popular local bar, Shi' Karra hears a lot of interesting gossip and has a keen sense of reading people. She might provide insights or information over a strong drink.

**4. Warehouse Workers Union:** The people who keep the station running smoothly in the background, they might stumble upon or be aware of unusual occurrences that could prove useful to the investigators, especially if they believe it could safeguard their jobs and normalcy. 

**5. Robotics & AI Research Lab:** While more interested in advancing science than the intricacies of inter-corporate politics, the scientists might assist if approached correctly. Their specialized knowledge could prove useful in warding off cyber-attacks, dealing with security systems, or understanding any weird tech our detectives might encounter.

**6. Street Art Guilds:** These often overlooked artists possess a unique perspective of the station life. Their works might contain unnoticed clues or they might have seen something in the course of their unconventional work hours. A street artist might be coerced into providing important visual clues or interpreting messages hidden in other artists' works.
