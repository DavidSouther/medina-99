Mistress Zephira's plan involves several steps:

1. **Data Theft:** First, she will initiate low-level cyber-attacks using sophisticated malware and hacking techniques to gather sensitive data and confidential communication logs from the databases of the interstellar corporations operating on Medina-99.

2. **Analysis and Distortion:** Once Zephira has her hands on the information, she will analyze it and, where necessary, introduce misinformation or exaggerate implications to make the corporations appear manipulative and corrupt. 

3. **Release of Information:** Zephira will periodically release batches of this distorted data and information to the public through anonymous channels. She plans to time the releases to maximize the political impact, such as right before key elections or corporate board meetings.

4. **Fueling the Dissent:** As the revelations from the data leaks cause public outrage, Zephira plans to covertly fuel protests and demonstrations to create instability in the station's peace. This will involve mobilizing online communities and providing resources to on-the-ground protest movements.

5. **Final Blow:** Once the corporations' power is weakened due to the public backlash and unrest, Zephira plans to launch a massive cyber-attack against their systems, causing widespread dysfunction and chaos. She hopes this will prompt a crackdown by the authorities, further feeding the public outrage and leading to a revolution on Medina-99.

6. **The Aftermath:** The ultimate goal of Zephira's plan is to depose the current corporate-dominated system, leaving a power vacuum which she believes will lead to a more egalitarian society. However, she's also aware that she might inadvertently make way for more radical elements who could seize this opportunity for their own ends.
  
To implement her plan, Zephira will need to act stealthily and keep the detectives preoccupied. She may set up sub-plots such as fake cyber attacks, propagate rumors of potential terrorist acts, or even set off actual physical threats using her henchmen, all to distract the authorities' attention from her real moves.
