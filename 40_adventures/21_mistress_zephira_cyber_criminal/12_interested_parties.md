  Who are additional parties interested in the outcome of the crime, or in
  stopping the crime, aside from the players?
---
Several other parties have a vested interest in the outcome of Zephira's activities:

**1. Global Corporations:** The interstellar corporations, being the primary targets of Zephira's plan, are inherently interested in stopping her. They have their corporate security teams employed and also hire private investigators to stop the data theft and to contain any potential scandals that might damage their image.

**2. The Station Overseer:** The person in charge of the day-to-day operations of the station, the Station Overseer, also has a stake in maintaining peace and order. Increased public unrest and potential revolution are bad for business and stability, and could cause a crisis. 

**3. Pro-Corporate Politicians:** There are politicians within the station's government whose campaigns are funded by these corporations. They would be interested in stopping Zephira to protect their backers and their own political futures.

**4. Resistance Groups:** There may also be groups resistant to corporate control who see Zephira as a beacon of hope. They would be interested in her success, seeing it as a stepping stone towards their own goals for the station.

**5. Independent Media:** Investigative journalists and independent media outlets might be interested in the information leaks, aiming to validate the information and potentially capitalize on the scoops for their own ends. However, they could also play a crucial role in exposing Zephira's distorted information.

**6. Alien Diplomats:** Alien diplomats residing on the station might have interests in the outcome as well. If the corporations are destabilized, the trade and diplomatic agreements could be affected, shifting the balance of power in their favor or disadvantage.

These parties could become allies or further complicate matters for the detectives as they work to investigate and stop Zephira's plans.
