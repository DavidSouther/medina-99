  As their plot progresses, if the players don't intervene, what further clues
  will they leave behind?
---
If the players choose not to intervene immediately, they will encounter a cascade of inconsequential yet highly noticeable anomalies:

1. A slight increase in exotic pet purchases: As the llamas are sheared and then sold to innocent buyers, there's a sudden influx of space llamas appearing all over Medina-99. People begin discussing llamas as the new "rage" in house pets, and the unexpected popularity even makes a blip on the local news stations.

2. Unusual llama wool products in the market: The knitting grannies start to sell incredibly warm products made from the llama wool. This may come to the player's attention when they notice everyone using and praising the startling effectiveness of these warm scarves and mittens. Inspection of these products will reveal they're made from space llama wool, which is very unusual for the Medina market.

3. Old Smuggling Routes reopening: Local space truckers and pilots might start sharing rumors in bars and lounges about long-abandoned smuggling routes suddenly seeing traffic again. They might even joke about the "Silver Foxes making a comeback". This could be added onto chatter the players overhear or get reported to them if they have connections among pilots or use Smarts to gain this info.

4. Overheard gossip from the grannies: The knitting grannies, considering they are mostly innocuous, might reveal parts of their operation unknowingly. Perhaps a snippet of conversation overheard in the local park about 'how the new wool deliveries are such a lifesaver' or one granny proudly showing off a picture on her communicator of a freshly sheared space llama to her friends while at a public café.

Each of these clues serve to solidify the operation of a vast wool collection and distribution network, centered around the highly prized (and previously thought secure) space llamas. The players' challenge will be piecing together these seemingly unrelated socioeconomic shifts and tracing them back to the guilty grannies and their sneaky silver-haired accomplices.
