A shipment of llama wool was mistakenly delivered to the local Medina-99 Sci-Fi and Comic Book club instead of the infamous knitting grannies. The comic book club was expecting a shipment of replica superhero capes for their annual Cos-Medina-Con.

The llama wool was encased in a special protective cover for the transport, clearly labeled 'Space Llama Wool - Handle With Care'. This anomaly piqued the interest of our hero detectives, who were notified by the Comic Book Club's president, a non-combatant NPC named Gabby Geek who has the aspect "Has an Eye For Detail and An Ear For Trouble".

This mistake provided our detectives with the possibility of a connection between the prized space llamas of space Machu Picchu and Medina-99, something not ordinarily seen in suburban space life. As a result, the detectives will be inclined to manage this situation and will begin conducting investigations and analyzing the links.
