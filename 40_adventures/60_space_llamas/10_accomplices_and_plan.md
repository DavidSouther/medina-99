The accomplices to the granny coven are a group of semi-retired smugglers known for their cunning and resourcefulness called "The Silver Foxes". The Silver Foxes are considered captains in NPC levels. They are led by their wily leader Captain Doris with a Good Skill for smuggling and an Average Grit, and she boasts the aspects "Crafty as a Fox" and "Reformed? Maybe.". She is ably assisted by Lieutenant Basil who has an Average Smarts and an Average Cool, with the aspect "Keeps His Head When Others Don't". 

The plan is simple; The Silver Foxes will use their old smuggling routes to covertly transport the space llamas from the space Machu Picchu to Medina-99. Once there, The Knitting Grannies will shear the llamas and weave their wool into warmer suits for the frigid temperatures of their home. 

Once the wool is used, the space llamas will then be delivered to various animal loving patrons who have no idea of the plot, thus providing the Silver Foxes with a good income and freeing space for new llamas. This also helps to avoid any possible suspicion as the llamas will not be killed or abused, merely sheared and given to new homes.
