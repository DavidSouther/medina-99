  stopping the crime, aside from the players?

1. The Galactic Llama Rescue Society (GLRS): A group of dedicated animal welfare activists led by Captain Roberto "Bob" O'Hara might be interested in investigating the sudden spike in llama pet ownership. His attributes include Good Smarts and Average Skills in animal rescue. His guiding aspects are "Man's best friend comes in all forms" and "Doing it for the animals". They might become allies of the players if they are convinced about the illicit llama shearing operation.

2. Rogue trader Shava "The Shark" Johannson: A lieutenant-ranked individual who is known for dealing exotic animal products. Her attributes are an Average Muscle and Skill in trading. She isn't happy about other traders entering her territory, and may try to sabotage their operations, hinting at the Silver Foxes involvement. She carries the aspect "I didn't claw my way up by sharing my pie".

3. Space Machu Picchu Tourism Board: A slight dip in llama sightings impact their touristic appeal, forcing them to take notice. A non-combatant NPC representative of the board, Manuel Pacha, an Average Grit official with the aspect "Passionately protective of the tourism revenue".

4. Cosmic Fiber Confederacy: A somewhat mysterious and innocuous group of yarn aficionados who see the knitting grannies elevated products as unfair competition. They might want to put a stop to the Grannies' operation, possibly by hiring a detective. They are led by Lydia, a non-combatant NPC with the aspect "Wool is life, life is wool".

These interested parties provide possible allies, antagonists, as well as informational and resource avenues for the players as they navigate this "hair-raising" crime. They could also provide additional side quests or challenges depending on how the players interact with them.
