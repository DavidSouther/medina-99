During the latest act of sabotage carried out by the team to test their warp jamming device, a small skirmish broke out between the pirates and the security forces of a small transport vessel. During the encounter, Uzol the "Juggernaut", being the frontliner, lost a piece of his custom-made armor plating.

This piece of armor is unique and distinctive, made from a rare alloy only found in the mining colonies of the harsh Yshlok Planet, a place known for high criminal activities and brute labor camps. The armor piece also bears the distinctive mark or symbol of the Ironfist pirates, a secret runic design known only to a few in the underworld that represents the brutal pirate captain Borlo "The Ironfist" Banes. 

This bit of armor might seem just a piece of junk at first, but to those knowledgeable in the galaxy's murkier dealings, it's a clue that an infamously ruthless pirate crew has set their sights on the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station of Medina-99. This would certainly spark an investigation by the detectives who patrol the habitation ring, as the safety and peace of their home turf are being threatened.
