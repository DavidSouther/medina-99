**1. Stellar Security Bureau (SSB):** This is a large intergalactic law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining peace and security across known space. They would be very interested in cracking down on Borlo's operation and bringing the notorious pirate to justice. Once they learn about the disrupted warp drive routes and the other clues, they would likely dedicate substantial resources to solve the case and apprehend the criminals.

**2. The Torelli Mining Company:** As the primary company that operates in the mining colonies on Yshlok Planet, the Torelli Mining Co. has a vested interest in ensuring its supply lines remain uninterrupted. Any disruption to the transportation of their goods and resources would surely attract their attention, and they might hire external mercenaries or private investigators to look into this issue if they feel authorities are not doing enough.

**3. Habitation Ring Residents:** Many of the residents on the Medina ring would be directly affected by the ongoing disruptions, as many of them are connected to the trades along these warp drive routes. The longer the problem persists, the more likely it is that individuals or groups from the ring would start their own investigations or protests.

**4. Alien Syndicates:** The space routes in and out of Medina-99 are also critical to several Interstellar Syndicates. Forged from alliances between different criminal groups of various alien races, they, too, rely on these routes for their shadowy activities. They may not care about the goods being pirates, but stability is vital for their operations, and a notorious pirate like Borlo wreaking havoc is bad for business. Be it hiring assassins, bounty hunters, or dealing with Banes personally, these syndicates won't stand idle for long.

**5. Rival Pirate Groups:** Superiority and control over the prime piracy zones are often contested among the space pirates, and Borlo's increased activities might irk other pirate groups. They might consider this as trespassing their 'turf' and could interfere with Borlo's piracy or even go as far as such a notorious pirate is out of the picture.
