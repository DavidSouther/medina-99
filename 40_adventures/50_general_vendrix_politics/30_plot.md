**Potential new clues:**

1. **Sudden Wealth:** Lesser officials and contractors suddenly affording high-end luxuries could hint at the bribe culture initiated by Xaela Vendrix. This would draw attention from vigilant detectives who notice these inexplicable and irregular discrepancies.

2. **Changes in Station Operation:** Increased instances of operational hiccups, substandard goods and services, and a gradual decline in the station's efficiency and safety could be traced back to Xaela's manipulations.

3. **Digital Irregularities:** Tech-savvy characters may pick up on anomalies within the station's data systems - unauthorized access, information alteration, and money trails that just don't add up. These could lead back to Lieutenant Korin Zef.

4. **Intimidation & Violence:** Gen Bova's rough handling of people unwilling to cooperate may draw the attention of detectives. A string of complaints about threats, assaults, or strong-arm tactics could have Bova's name repeatedly popping up, revealing his role as an enforcer and making them suspicious.

5. **Suspicion among Staff:** The station's staff may show signs of unease or fear, with some maybe even trying to approach the detectives covertly to express their worries about the new order of things. 

Remember, these clues are not laid out like breadcrumbs for players. Each clue must be pushed further into the narrative as the consequences of the villain's plot start to affect the station more severely. This way, players feel the urgency increasing if they do not act or solve the puzzle in time.
