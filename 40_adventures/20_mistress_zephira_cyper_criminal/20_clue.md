During one of their initial operations, Vox, the technopath of the group, was forced to cover their tracks by causing a small system-wide glitch on Medina-99's computer networks. The glitch was short-lived but extensive and most people brushed it off as a power surge or system maintenance. However, amid the chaos of the glitch, several encrypted files were accidentally and momentarily made public. 

These files contained seemingly a series of cryptic numbers, letters, and symbols that ostensibly made no sense to the common viewer. However, those well-versed in advanced cryptography and network systems might notice that these seemingly random sequences are actually fragments of an incredibly intricate and advanced hacking code, far beyond the capabilities of any average cyber-criminal on Medina-99.

The clue hooks in the players as only a select few within the law enforcement or network security specialists would be familiar with such complex codes. This out-of-place event would raise their eyebrows and spark an interest in finding out who is behind this highly sophisticated hacking attempt and what their real plan might be.

Also, along with the digital clue, Plex had to rush the fabrication of one of their scouting robots due to the urgency of the operation. This led to a robotics component being left behind in one of the ducts of the Gell-I-10 Transfer Station during the reconnaissance stage.

The tiny component, which is not openly available on the market, indicates that it's a part of an unknown robotics model, that if traced would not match any legal or known robotic prototypes. Technicians at the station would flag it as unusual, drawing attention from the law enforcement. Especially if they already have a suspect detective who has a keen interest in robotics or technology.
