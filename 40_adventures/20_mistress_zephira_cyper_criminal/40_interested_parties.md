**1. Teragon Corp:** A massive cross-systems conglomerate in space agriculture. They are suspected of nepotism and corrupt practices. They would be extremely interested in suppressing this supposed hacktivist group, as they would be one of the alleged entities that Zephira's information could expose.

**2. United Investigators Bureau (UIB):** A central investigative body for the stellar civilizations, UIB agents are dedicated to maintaining law and order throughout the various space colonies and transfer stations. They’ve noticed the anomalies that Zephira and her team have left in their wake and are actively investigating the cyber-threat.

**3. "The Stateless":** An underground group of hackers and activists, The Stateless thrive in the underbelly of the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station. If they catch wind of Zephira's plan, they might either lend her their hidden support, or see her team as rivals, and attempt to sabotage or ride on their coattails to create chaos for their own ends.

**4. A'ziri Alliance:** An alien coalition from one of the stellar civilizations. They are interested in maintaining the balance of power. The Alliance might clandestinely try to aid Zephira in her mission, seeing it as an opportunity to weaken human interstellar corporations.

**5. Althea Stormborn:** A renowned investigative journalist from Medina-99 who has been trying to expose corporate corruption for years. Once she stumbles upon Zephira's leaked info, she might get involved actively, either trying to reach out to Zephira or doing her own parallel investigations to verify the leaked intel.

**6. Fortune Security Solutions:** A private security company responsible for the physical and cyber protection of several corporations that are in Zephira’s crosshairs. As they would be held accountable for any security breaches, the company would be interested in stopping the cyber-attacks.
