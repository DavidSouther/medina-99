Further interested parties may include:

1. **The Corporate Elite**: The high-powered executives and shareholders in the robotics company that dismissed Vaxis may have a keen interest in the outcome. They would want to see Vaxis stopped before his plans come to fruition as a demonstration of his dangerous genius could ruin their businessâ€™s reputation, and potential justice for his dismissal would not be palatable either.

2. **Kor'Ra The Alien Crime Lord**: The notorious Kor'Ra would be interested in ensuring that Medina-99 stays quite as it is. This Alien Crime Lord has significant hidden investments running across this stellar hub of civilization. If Vaxis' plan unfolds completely, it could destabilize the economy and have severe repercussions on his under-the-radar operations.

3. **Dr. Ferron Lux**: Dr. Lux is an esteemed roboticist with a personal history with Vaxis, both being in the robotics field. Recently, he's been working towards creating AI rules and regulations for stellar systems, focusing on safety and ethics. The rogue robotic activity would not only affect residents' opinion on robots but also pose a threat to his life's work.

4. **The Union of Stellar Transport Workers:** If Vaxis takes control over Grell-I-10 Transfer Station, it would cause chaos in the interstellar transport system, impacting the jobs of thousands of workers unified in this union. They would have a vested interest in ensuring normalcy is restored before their livelihoods are jeopardized.

5. **Task Force Spectra:** This Specialized multi-species enforcement division handles high-risk threats across the stellar hub. Although they usually handle larger scale issues, if Vaxis's plans escalate, they might step in, offering an interesting dynamic and potential support or competition to the players.
