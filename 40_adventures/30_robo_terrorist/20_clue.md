Clue: **A Mysterious Mosaic Circuit Board**

Unknown to Vaxis, Coral, in a rush to create the device to breach the station's main computer system, had left behind a defective version of what she dubs a "mosaic circuit board". During her fitting at a discretely located makeshift lab on the ring, the defective board had malfunctioned, heating up and causing a micro-explosion which jettisoned it from the lab's chute out into the residential sector of the ring.

This circuit board is not your typical board. It's designed with impressive intricacy and embedded with exotic, valuable tech components. The board, charred and warped from the micro-explosion, landed mysteriously right on the doorstep of a resident's habi-pod, causing a minor panic among the dwellers.

The board's unique impact crater, combined with the unusual energy signature it emitted and its strange allure, prompted the residents to call in the authorities - giving our heroes the first taste of something big going down on humble Medina-99.

The mosaic circuit board gives the heroic detectives their first real clue and a tangible piece of evidence to start investigating, who made this? why? where did it come from? Its rich tech detail and rare components offer a piece of a puzzle that just doesn't fit into the otherwise peaceful suburban ring.
