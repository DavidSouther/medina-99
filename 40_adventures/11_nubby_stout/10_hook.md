The Nubby Stout is your favorite local watering hole. Oliver, the proprietor, is as gregarious and friendly as they come, it's the bar's Nubby Stout that is world-famous for its flavor, complexity, and just dang goodness!

> "It's horrible!" shouts Oliver, proprietor of the Nubby Stout, as you walk in for a sip. "The Nubby Stout's decanter of endless stout has been cursed! It now only pours... Space Natty Light!"

The horror! You look around and go to help out.

There's another patron in the tavern, and you could also look behind the bar.
