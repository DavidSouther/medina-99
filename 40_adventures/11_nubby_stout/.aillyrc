Background

Rodrac [Awakened Chihuahua] means to steal weapons!
A shopkeep [Deej, Human] has a weapons license.
Rodrac intends to recruit Rolf Boulderfuck [Person] to fuck through the warehouse ceiling, but needs a vhs player (communication node)Â [Relic] to open a back door.
The shop next door to the Nubby Stout, [Location], recently shuttered up, but there's been people apparently renovating it.
In fact, that shop is above the weapons shop's warehouse, and Rodrac is preparing his caper!
The VHS interference and has magically affected the replicator of endless stout.
