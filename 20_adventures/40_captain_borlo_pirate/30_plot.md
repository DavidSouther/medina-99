**Clue 1: Altered Warp Drive Routes**
The team will notice that several warp drive routes have been altered or are experiencing unexplained disruptions. Upon close examination, these routes happen to be the primary ones for transport vehicles carrying valuable resources. The navigational changes and disruptions would be signature traits of Borlo's piracy but may require some digging to realize this connection.

**Clue 2: Hacked Communications Network**
Mira, the group's strategist, will inevitably leave traces of her hacks in the communication networks of the transports. These anomalies in the data traffic might initially go unnoticed due to the vast amount of daily interstellar communication. But their persistence around the incidents of piracy would eventually alert someone keen on pattern recognition.

**Clue 3: Weapon Residue from Pirate Attacks**
From physical confrontations during the ongoing pirate attacks, residue from the heavy weaponry may often be left behind. Among these, traces of the Grell-specific weaponry used by Graak could be an intriguing find. It's common knowledge that Grell are not often involved in piracy, and such an anomaly could make someone dig deeper into these incidents. 

**Clue 4: Abnormal Activity in the Uncharted Region**
The uncharted region where Borlo and his crew retreat after their operations might also draw some attention. As successful heists increase, activity in this once-quiet region would spike. If the players or any vigilant parties map out these unusual activities, they might find the pirate hideout or at least suspect there's something worth investigating in the area.
