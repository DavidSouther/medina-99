**Accomplices:**

**1. Rigel-7** (Level - Soldier, Attributes - +1 Toughness, -1 Smarts, Aspect - "Alien Brute Force")
   Crime: Physical Intimidation
   Role: Rigel-7 is Zephiraâ€™s muscle for when her digital endeavors attract physical danger. A somewhat gullible but fiercely loyal alien from a high gravity world, he ensures that their physical location is secure and handles any 'unwanted' attention.

**2. Plex** (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Skill (Robotics), Aspect - "Cybernetic Tinkerer")
   Crime: Creating Illegal Tech
   Role: Plex is the brains behind the cybernetic elements of Zephira's hacktivist operations. Ambitious and ingenious, he designs and constructs advanced drones and hacking robots, which are then used to access physically secure areas or distract security forces.

**3. Vox** (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Cool, +1 Skill (Technology), Aspect - "Silent Technopath")
   Crimes: Hacking and Sabotage
   Role: Vox is the silent partner in cybercrimes, a technopath who can communicate with and control technology on a profound level. He can manipulate systems and firewall protections, paving the way for Zephira's digital heists.

**Plan:**

Zephira and her team plan to expose the corrupt interstellar corporations by hacking into their main servers, located within the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station's security grid. 

Rigel-7 will be the front line, providing physical security for their operations. Plex, with his robotic creations, will provide physical reconnaissance and distractions within the station when needed. 

Vox will firstly sabotage the Transfer Station's internal surveillance system, making it blind to their digital and physical intrusions. Then, Vox and Plex would infiltrate the digital security, bypassing layers of high-level encryptions to establish a safe and stable connection for Zephira.

Once in the system, Zephira would download as much confidential information as possible and safely leak it to the public, thereby exposing the corruption and manipulation of politics on Medina-99. The information would be dispersed in different media channels anonymously to avoid all possible traces. 

They would then disconnect and go back to ground, disappearing into the bustling half-million residents of Grell-I-10 Transfer Station until their next target presents itself.
