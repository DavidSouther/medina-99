**The leftover clue:**

As a result of one of their corrupt deals, there was an accident - a supply shipment to the artifial gravity generator was substituted with substandard materials to cut corners and create a surplus for Xaela and her accomplices. Anyone investigating the incident would initially believe that it was simply due to negligence or cost-cutting. 

However, the players come across an anomaly - a data pad left at the scene by accident - belonging to one of Bray's subordinates. This data pad contains encrypted communications that hint at deliberate sabotage and also mention a meeting occurrence - the details of which are cleverly hidden behind codewords. 

The codewords reference seemingly innocuous acts but might seem out of place or suspicious - 'feeding the fish,' 'taking out the trash', 'paying the landlord.' These could be initial leads for the players to start unraveling the plot. 

This data pad clue should intrigue players. They would need to decrypt the anomaly, understand the codewords, and eventually link it to the larger corruption scheme headed by General Xaela Vendrix.
