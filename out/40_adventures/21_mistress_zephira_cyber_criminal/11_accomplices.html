<p><strong>1. Riker:</strong> A hulking humanoid from the outer systems, Riker acts as the muscle behind Zephira&#39;s operations. While he&#39;s not very skilled in the legal or technological aspects of their operations, his physical prowess and intimidating presence make him an effective enforcer for keeping potential dissenters (and discoverers) in check. (Soldier level with +1 in Muscle and -1 in Law)</p>
<p><strong>2. Silence:</strong> This masked individual is Zephira&#39;s primary hacking accomplice. Silence is a software savant with a knack for disappearing into the digital shadows when danger is near. They are essential for the data theft and cyber-attack aspects of the plan. (Sergeant level with +1 in Technology)</p>
<p><strong>3. Zel:</strong> Zel is a master saboteur from a species adept at blending into their surroundings. He is an expert in causing mayhem when needed, using alien tech to trigger disturbances or accidents that draw attention away from Zephira&#39;s true intentions. (Soldier level with +1 in Alien Culture and Psychology and -1 in Law)</p>
<p>Each of these operatives brings valuable skills and knowledge to Zephira&#39;s team, but a lack of legal expertise and a reliance on more illicit activities may prove to be their downfall.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_11_accomplices --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_plan.html">Previous: Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./12_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>Â©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
