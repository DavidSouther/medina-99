<li><p><strong>The Tip-Off</strong> - Mistress Zephira initiates her plan with a seemingly insignificant cyber-attack, stealing some benign data. The relatively low-level intrusion only hints at what is to come, while drawing the attention of our detectives to her activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Blueprint</strong> - Zephira and her accomplices are planning a series of major data thefts, each more daring and impactful than the last. They are preparing their systems and fine-tuning their applications to ensure success, while the detectives start to piece together the scale of the threat.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Stakeout</strong> - Zephira lays low, observing the reaction of the corporations, the authorities, and the public to her initial move. She&#39;s also keeping a keen eye on the detectives, ready to divert or mislead them as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Smoke Screen</strong> - Zephira releases a carefully curated and distorted batch of stolen data, sparking public outrage and keeping the detectives distracted. Meanwhile, she&#39;s also spreading misleading information about her hacker cell&#39;s location and composition, throwing law enforcement off her trail.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Alibi</strong> - As the detectives start to make progress, Zephira orchestrates a conspicuous high-profile hacking incident traced to a different location at the same time she&#39;s planning her biggest data theft yet. This step not only confuses the investigation but also solidifies her alibi.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Vanishing Act</strong> - The moment she&#39;s been waiting for. After releasing her final, most sensational batch of manipulated information, and delivering her crippling cyber-attack on the corporations, Zephira plans to disappear. Using her exceptional hacking skills, she erases her existence from digital records, leaves no physical trace, and prepares to watch the chaos unfold from her hidden sanctuary.</p>
