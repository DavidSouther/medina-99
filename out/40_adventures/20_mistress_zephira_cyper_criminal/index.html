<p><strong>1. Rigel-7</strong> (Level - Soldier, Attributes - +1 Toughness, -1 Smarts, Aspect - &quot;Alien Brute Force&quot;)
   Crime: Physical Intimidation
   Role: Rigel-7 is Zephira’s muscle for when her digital endeavors attract physical danger. A somewhat gullible but fiercely loyal alien from a high gravity world, he ensures that their physical location is secure and handles any &#39;unwanted&#39; attention.</p>
<p><strong>2. Plex</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Skill (Robotics), Aspect - &quot;Cybernetic Tinkerer&quot;)
   Crime: Creating Illegal Tech
   Role: Plex is the brains behind the cybernetic elements of Zephira&#39;s hacktivist operations. Ambitious and ingenious, he designs and constructs advanced drones and hacking robots, which are then used to access physically secure areas or distract security forces.</p>
<p><strong>3. Vox</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Cool, +1 Skill (Technology), Aspect - &quot;Silent Technopath&quot;)
   Crimes: Hacking and Sabotage
   Role: Vox is the silent partner in cybercrimes, a technopath who can communicate with and control technology on a profound level. He can manipulate systems and firewall protections, paving the way for Zephira&#39;s digital heists.</p>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong></p>
<p>Zephira and her team plan to expose the corrupt interstellar corporations by hacking into their main servers, located within the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station&#39;s security grid. </p>
<p>Rigel-7 will be the front line, providing physical security for their operations. Plex, with his robotic creations, will provide physical reconnaissance and distractions within the station when needed. </p>
<p>Vox will firstly sabotage the Transfer Station&#39;s internal surveillance system, making it blind to their digital and physical intrusions. Then, Vox and Plex would infiltrate the digital security, bypassing layers of high-level encryptions to establish a safe and stable connection for Zephira.</p>
<p>Once in the system, Zephira would download as much confidential information as possible and safely leak it to the public, thereby exposing the corruption and manipulation of politics on Medina-99. The information would be dispersed in different media channels anonymously to avoid all possible traces. </p>
<p>They would then disconnect and go back to ground, disappearing into the bustling half-million residents of Grell-I-10 Transfer Station until their next target presents itself.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_10_accomplices_and_plan --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Next: Clue</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_20_clue (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_20_clue"><header><nav><h1>Clue</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal">Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_20_clue">Clue</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>During one of their initial operations, Vox, the technopath of the group, was forced to cover their tracks by causing a small system-wide glitch on Medina-99&#39;s computer networks. The glitch was short-lived but extensive and most people brushed it off as a power surge or system maintenance. However, amid the chaos of the glitch, several encrypted files were accidentally and momentarily made public. </p>
<p>These files contained seemingly a series of cryptic numbers, letters, and symbols that ostensibly made no sense to the common viewer. However, those well-versed in advanced cryptography and network systems might notice that these seemingly random sequences are actually fragments of an incredibly intricate and advanced hacking code, far beyond the capabilities of any average cyber-criminal on Medina-99.</p>
<p>The clue hooks in the players as only a select few within the law enforcement or network security specialists would be familiar with such complex codes. This out-of-place event would raise their eyebrows and spark an interest in finding out who is behind this highly sophisticated hacking attempt and what their real plan might be.</p>
<p>Also, along with the digital clue, Plex had to rush the fabrication of one of their scouting robots due to the urgency of the operation. This led to a robotics component being left behind in one of the ducts of the Gell-I-10 Transfer Station during the reconnaissance stage.</p>
<p>The tiny component, which is not openly available on the market, indicates that it&#39;s a part of an unknown robotics model, that if traced would not match any legal or known robotic prototypes. Technicians at the station would flag it as unusual, drawing attention from the law enforcement. Especially if they already have a suspect detective who has a keen interest in robotics or technology.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_30_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_30_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal">Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_30_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>Should the players not intervene timely, Zephira and her team’s ongoing operations would inevitably lead to more clues. Here’s what the team might unintentionally leave behind:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Suspicious Energy Consumption</strong>: The server rooms in the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station might experience inexplicably high energy draws due to Zephira and Vox&#39;s hacking activities. This might cause the station&#39;s temperature control mechanisms to malfunction, raising questions from maintenance teams and savvy onlookers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Irrational Behaviour by AI Systems</strong>: Vox&#39;s technopathy would cause AI systems he interacts with to behave strangely. Security protocols, AI-based vending machines, telecommunications, and even the AI of player&#39;s own devices might spout gibberish or exhibit unusual glitches. These odd behaviors, if analyzed, could lead back to their operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Signs of Drone Recon</strong>: Plex&#39;s robotic creations would leave traces of their explorations. Slight damage to duct systems, or more refined robotics components (much like the one from previous operations) might be found at various out-of-reach or restricted locations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Anomalies</strong>: Zephira&#39;s data downloads would inevitably leave digital traces. Some data will show signs of being accessed or copied abnormally. These data anomalies can be picked up by advanced algorithms used for data integrity checks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strange Illness</strong>: Rigel-7 is an alien whose biochemistry isn&#39;t entirely compatible with the human-populated Medina-99. Chronic exposure to his alien biology - an unusual skin cell here, an odd chemical secretion there - may result in mild, unexplainable illnesses in people who frequent areas where Rigel-7 spends a lot of time. Cyber-medical specialists or xenobiologists might make this connection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If investigated closely, these signs would all point towards a well-coordinated operation conducted by entities skilled in hacking, robotics, and bearing an unusually advanced level of power and technology.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./31_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_31_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_31_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal">Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_31_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_31_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Previous: Plot</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_40_interested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_40_interested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Interested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal">Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_40_interested_parties">Interested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1.
