Morwen Deep-Data</strong>: As the head of security for a major data farm -- which has so far been ignored by Zephira’s campaign -- the stoic Morwen has firsthand experience with protecting information from talented hackers. She might be convinced to lend her expertise in network security.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sazir Corps</strong>: Sazir Corps is a biomedical corporation specializing in Xenobiology and they might have research on Rigel-7&#39;s species. If the players can convince the Sazir Corps that the case has some merit, they might agree to aid with information on Rigel-7&#39;s biology to anticipate his actions.</p>

University of Stellar Studies (USS)</strong>: While not directly interested in the crime, the esteemed researchers and professors of the USS might be able to provide assistance in everything from understanding the cryptic hacking code to interpreting the alien biological clues left by Rigel-7.</p>
