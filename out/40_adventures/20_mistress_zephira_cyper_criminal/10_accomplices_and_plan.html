<p><strong>1. Rigel-7</strong> (Level - Soldier, Attributes - +1 Toughness, -1 Smarts, Aspect - &quot;Alien Brute Force&quot;)
   Crime: Physical Intimidation
   Role: Rigel-7 is Zephira’s muscle for when her digital endeavors attract physical danger. A somewhat gullible but fiercely loyal alien from a high gravity world, he ensures that their physical location is secure and handles any &#39;unwanted&#39; attention.</p>
<p><strong>2. Plex</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Skill (Robotics), Aspect - &quot;Cybernetic Tinkerer&quot;)
   Crime: Creating Illegal Tech
   Role: Plex is the brains behind the cybernetic elements of Zephira&#39;s hacktivist operations. Ambitious and ingenious, he designs and constructs advanced drones and hacking robots, which are then used to access physically secure areas or distract security forces.</p>
<p><strong>3. Vox</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Cool, +1 Skill (Technology), Aspect - &quot;Silent Technopath&quot;)
   Crimes: Hacking and Sabotage
   Role: Vox is the silent partner in cybercrimes, a technopath who can communicate with and control technology on a profound level. He can manipulate systems and firewall protections, paving the way for Zephira&#39;s digital heists.</p>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong></p>
<p>Zephira and her team plan to expose the corrupt interstellar corporations by hacking into their main servers, located within the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station&#39;s security grid. </p>
<p>Rigel-7 will be the front line, providing physical security for their operations. Plex, with his robotic creations, will provide physical reconnaissance and distractions within the station when needed. </p>
<p>Vox will firstly sabotage the Transfer Station&#39;s internal surveillance system, making it blind to their digital and physical intrusions. Then, Vox and Plex would infiltrate the digital security, bypassing layers of high-level encryptions to establish a safe and stable connection for Zephira.</p>
<p>Once in the system, Zephira would download as much confidential information as possible and safely leak it to the public, thereby exposing the corruption and manipulation of politics on Medina-99. The information would be dispersed in different media channels anonymously to avoid all possible traces. </p>
<p>They would then disconnect and go back to ground, disappearing into the bustling half-million residents of Grell-I-10 Transfer Station until their next target presents itself.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_10_accomplices_and_plan --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Next: Clue</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
