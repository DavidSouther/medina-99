<p>Unknown to Vaxis, Coral, in a rush to create the device to breach the station&#39;s main computer system, had left behind a defective version of what she dubs a &quot;mosaic circuit board&quot;. During her fitting at a discretely located makeshift lab on the ring, the defective board had malfunctioned, heating up and causing a micro-explosion which jettisoned it from the lab&#39;s chute out into the residential sector of the ring.</p>
<p>This circuit board is not your typical board. It&#39;s designed with impressive intricacy and embedded with exotic, valuable tech components. The board, charred and warped from the micro-explosion, landed mysteriously right on the doorstep of a resident&#39;s habi-pod, causing a minor panic among the dwellers.</p>
<p>The board&#39;s unique impact crater, combined with the unusual energy signature it emitted and its strange allure, prompted the residents to call in the authorities - giving our heroes the first taste of something big going down on humble Medina-99.</p>
<p>The mosaic circuit board gives the heroic detectives their first real clue and a tangible piece of evidence to start investigating, who made this? why? where did it come from? Its rich tech detail and rare components offer a piece of a puzzle that just doesn&#39;t fit into the otherwise peaceful suburban ring.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>Â©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
