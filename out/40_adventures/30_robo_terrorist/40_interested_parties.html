<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Corporate Elite</strong>: The high-powered executives and shareholders in the robotics company that dismissed Vaxis may have a keen interest in the outcome. They would want to see Vaxis stopped before his plans come to fruition as a demonstration of his dangerous genius could ruin their business’s reputation, and potential justice for his dismissal would not be palatable either.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Kor&#39;Ra The Alien Crime Lord</strong>: The notorious Kor&#39;Ra would be interested in ensuring that Medina-99 stays quite as it is. This Alien Crime Lord has significant hidden investments running across this stellar hub of civilization. If Vaxis&#39; plan unfolds completely, it could destabilize the economy and have severe repercussions on his under-the-radar operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dr. Ferron Lux</strong>: Dr. Lux is an esteemed roboticist with a personal history with Vaxis, both being in the robotics field. Recently, he&#39;s been working towards creating AI rules and regulations for stellar systems, focusing on safety and ethics. The rogue robotic activity would not only affect residents&#39; opinion on robots but also pose a threat to his life&#39;s work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Union of Stellar Transport Workers:</strong> If Vaxis takes control over Grell-I-10 Transfer Station, it would cause chaos in the interstellar transport system, impacting the jobs of thousands of workers unified in this union. They would have a vested interest in ensuring normalcy is restored before their livelihoods are jeopardized.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Task Force Spectra:</strong> This Specialized multi-species enforcement division handles high-risk threats across the stellar hub. Although they usually handle larger scale issues, if Vaxis&#39;s plans escalate, they might step in, offering an interesting dynamic and potential support or competition to the players.</p>
