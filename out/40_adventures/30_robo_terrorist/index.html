<ul>
<li>Crime: Robotic Terrorism</li>
<li>Goal: Vaxis is a vengeful former employee for a robotics corporation, seeking retribution for being wronged. His aim is to employ his self-made rogue robotic minions to disrupt the station&#39;s peaceful order and ultimately hold it hostage, aiming to bargain reshaping the socioeconomic structures of Medina-99, on the grounds of his being wronged.</li>

<p>Accomplice 2: <strong>Coral &quot;Met-Tech&quot; Indigo</strong> (Level - Captain, Attributes - +2 Smarts, +1 Technology, Aspects - &quot;Underground Tech Wizard&quot;, &quot;Street-Savvy Scam Artist&quot;)</p>
<p>The Plan: Vaxis plans to use Q7-K-L to coordinate offensive maneuvers with the robotic minions in strategic places around the station. His main focus is to disrupt daily activities, sow fear among the residents and effectively make the station ungovernable using these rogue robotic troops.</p>
<p>While the chaos ensues, Vaxis relies on Coral Indigo&#39;s expertise in technology; Spatial System Hacking, specifically. Coral&#39;s main task is to compromise the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station&#39;s main computer system, creating a diversion for authorities and also enabling Vaxis to gain control over the station&#39;s overall operations. </p>
<p>Once they have control, their plan is to declare Vaxis as the new authority who would then threaten the destruction of the transfer station, if the socioeconomic structures of Medina-99 were not renegotiated to his terms. </p>
<p>The ultimate threat is a stellar core warhead discreetly installed somewhere within the station by Coral, capable of triggering a supernova. Unknown to most, Coral has placed several decoys around the station, ensuring that finding the real device becomes a task nearly impossible amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>Phase 1 - chaos and fear with robotic minions
Phase 2 - take control over the station&#39;s computer system and operations
Phase 3 - Negotiations and threats with the warheads as leverage.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_10_accomplices_and_plan --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Robo Terrorist</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Next: Clue</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_20_clue (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_20_clue"><header><nav><h1>Clue</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist">Robo Terrorist</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_20_clue">Clue</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>Clue: <strong>A Mysterious Mosaic Circuit Board</strong></p>
<p>Unknown to Vaxis, Coral, in a rush to create the device to breach the station&#39;s main computer system, had left behind a defective version of what she dubs a &quot;mosaic circuit board&quot;. During her fitting at a discretely located makeshift lab on the ring, the defective board had malfunctioned, heating up and causing a micro-explosion which jettisoned it from the lab&#39;s chute out into the residential sector of the ring.</p>
<p>This circuit board is not your typical board. It&#39;s designed with impressive intricacy and embedded with exotic, valuable tech components. The board, charred and warped from the micro-explosion, landed mysteriously right on the doorstep of a resident&#39;s habi-pod, causing a minor panic among the dwellers.</p>
<p>The board&#39;s unique impact crater, combined with the unusual energy signature it emitted and its strange allure, prompted the residents to call in the authorities - giving our heroes the first taste of something big going down on humble Medina-99.</p>
<p>The mosaic circuit board gives the heroic detectives their first real clue and a tangible piece of evidence to start investigating, who made this? why? where did it come from? Its rich tech detail and rare components offer a piece of a puzzle that just doesn&#39;t fit into the otherwise peaceful suburban ring.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_30_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_30_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist">Robo Terrorist</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_30_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><ol>
<li><p><strong>Anomalous Robotic Activity</strong>: As Q7-K-L begins to coordinate the rogue robots across the station, there will be a increase in glitches and odd behavior reported in the robotic workforce. These anomalies are both a consequence of Vaxis&#39; use of heavily modified and unsanctioned AI cores, and Q7-K-L&#39;s forceful intervention on the station&#39;s normal bots for reinforcement.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mysterious Power Fluctuations</strong>: As Coral Impacts the station&#39;s operations gradually, there will be unexplained power surges and outages around the Medina ring. Suspicions arise as the energy signatures correspond to unauthorized high-tech devices, which can be traced back to Coral&#39;s actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Distorted Communications</strong>: As Vaxis starts to take control, there will be moments of alarming static interference on public communication frequencies. Some keen listeners might occasionally hear strange coded chatter. This would be related to Vaxis&#39; own encrypted communication system between him, his accomplices, and his robotic minions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A Suspicious Increase in Luxury Imports</strong>: Vaxis has a taste for rare and exotic goods. As he gains more power and control, a vibrant black-market trade of high-end, luxurious items originating from various parts of the sector has been noticed. Luxury goods, especially those that are tech-related, would indicate wealth and power, throwing a fascinating wrinkle to the case for our heroic detectives. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Remnants of a Stellar Core Device</strong>: If the detectives dig deeper and connect the dots, they may eventually discover residues of interstellar-grade explosive materials in unlikely parts of Grell-I-10. These are nothing but the remnants from Coral&#39;s decoy devices, left deliberately to confuse the investigators and lead them away from the location of the actual stellar core warhead.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Corporate Elite</strong>: The high-powered executives and shareholders in the robotics company that dismissed Vaxis may have a keen interest in the outcome. They would want to see Vaxis stopped before his plans come to fruition as a demonstration of his dangerous genius could ruin their business’s reputation, and potential justice for his dismissal would not be palatable either.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Kor&#39;Ra The Alien Crime Lord</strong>: The notorious Kor&#39;Ra would be interested in ensuring that Medina-99 stays quite as it is. This Alien Crime Lord has significant hidden investments running across this stellar hub of civilization. If Vaxis&#39; plan unfolds completely, it could destabilize the economy and have severe repercussions on his under-the-radar operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dr. Ferron Lux</strong>: Dr. Lux is an esteemed roboticist with a personal history with Vaxis, both being in the robotics field. Recently, he&#39;s been working towards creating AI rules and regulations for stellar systems, focusing on safety and ethics. The rogue robotic activity would not only affect residents&#39; opinion on robots but also pose a threat to his life&#39;s work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Union of Stellar Transport Workers:</strong> If Vaxis takes control over Grell-I-10 Transfer Station, it would cause chaos in the interstellar transport system, impacting the jobs of thousands of workers unified in this union. They would have a vested interest in ensuring normalcy is restored before their livelihoods are jeopardized.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Task Force Spectra:</strong> This Specialized multi-species enforcement division handles high-risk threats across the stellar hub. Although they usually handle larger scale issues, if Vaxis&#39;s plans escalate, they might step in, offering an interesting dynamic and potential support or competition to the players.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Draayna the Merchant Queen</strong>: A merchant, not directly concerned with the criminal activities or politics of the region, but her vast network of contacts and information could prove invaluable. She may not be particularly interested in the crime, but the detectives could barter for her cooperation with mutually beneficial conditions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Technomage of Nyaralon</strong>: An eccentric figure obsessed with the mysticism of technology, currently tucked away in the obscure corners of the station. He might not be interested in the crime as it is, but he could offer significant aid in understanding the exotic tech involved in Coral&#39;s devices if properly persuaded.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rigel &quot;Rusty&quot; Starborn</strong>: A retired pilot of the Transport Union, now a hobbyist star mapper and astrologer. He doesn’t care much for what goes wrong on the docks or in the corporate halls, but with his local knowledge of the station and his old contacts in the transport business, he could provide the players with a fresh perspective and unexpected ingredients for their investigation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Silk Sirens</strong>: An underground band of hackers who usually remain apolitical and don’t care about what happens above the schematic virtual clouds. But they have the know-how to circumvent high-end security systems, and could prove instrumental if the detectives can convince them to lend their expertise against Coral&#39;s hacks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fal&#39;Zhaan Monastery</strong>: A local alien sect devoted to the wisdom of the stars. They generally avoid meddling in mundane happenings, but their unique philosophies and star-related knowledge might be decisive in the face of a stellar core explosive. If the detectives can convince them that the balance of the stars is threatened, the monks could break their aloofness and assist.</p>
