<li>Crime: Piracy</li>
<li>Goal: Captain Banes is an infamous space pirate known for his ruthlessness. His goal is to disrupt the warp drives routes, attempting to seize and loot transports carrying valuable resources in and out of Medina-99.</li>

<ul>
<li>Role: Mira is the brains behind Borlo&#39;s operations. She is a cunning and conniving individual who maps out their piracy routes and targets. She&#39;s also proactive at infiltrating networks and hacking systems to gain leverage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accomplice 2: Sergeant Uzol &quot;The Juggernaut&quot; Grav</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attribute - +1 Toughness, Aspect - &quot;Intimidating Muscle&quot;)</p>
<ul>
<li>Role: Uzol is the muscle of the team, responsible for dealing with any physical obstacles or threats. His imposing presence alone can often diffuse resistance and his loyalty to Borlo is unshakeable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accomplice 3: Soldier Graak, the Grell</strong> (Level - Soldier, Attribute - -1 Smarts, +1 Shooting, Aspect - &quot;Loyal Alien Mercenary&quot;)</p>
<ul>
<li>Role: Graak is a skilled marksman. Despite his average intelligence, his exceptional skill with an array of weapons more than makes up for it. He comes from a warrior race, the Grell, well-known around the galaxy for their combat prowess. Graak is very loyal to the team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong> The Iron Fist will disrupt the warp drive routes with the use of an illegally modified warp jamming device that Mira was able to steal and modify. This will effectively isolate the target transports and allow for an easy ambush by the pirate crew. Uzol and Graak will lead the boarding parties to secure the transport vehicles and subdue any crew not willing to cooperate. Mira will be in charge of hacking into the transports&#39; systems to ensure dominance over the controls while the looting is in progress. Their targeted resources are primarily rare minerals, high-tech components, and fuels, as per intelligence Mira strategically gathered. After the operation, they plan to retreat to their hidden asteroid base in an as yet uncharted section of the local system.</p></main></article><article id="40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_20_clue"><header><nav><h1>Clue</h1><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate">Captain Borlo Pirate</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_20_clue">Clue</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>During the latest act of sabotage carried out by the team to test their warp jamming device, a small skirmish broke out between the pirates and the security forces of a small transport vessel. During the encounter, Uzol the &quot;Juggernaut&quot;, being the frontliner, lost a piece of his custom-made armor plating.</p>
<p>This piece of armor is unique and distinctive, made from a rare alloy only found in the mining colonies of the harsh Yshlok Planet, a place known for high criminal activities and brute labor camps. The armor piece also bears the distinctive mark or symbol of the Ironfist pirates, a secret runic design known only to a few in the underworld that represents the brutal pirate captain Borlo &quot;The Ironfist&quot; Banes. </p>
<p>This bit of armor might seem just a piece of junk at first, but to those knowledgeable in the galaxy&#39;s murkier dealings, it&#39;s a clue that an infamously ruthless pirate crew has set their sights on the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station of Medina-99. This would certainly spark an investigation by the detectives who patrol the habitation ring, as the safety and peace of their home turf are being threatened.</p></main></article><article id="40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_30_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate">Captain Borlo Pirate</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_30_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>Clue 1: Altered Warp Drive Routes</strong>
The team will notice that several warp drive routes have been altered or are experiencing unexplained disruptions. Upon close examination, these routes happen to be the primary ones for transport vehicles carrying valuable resources. The navigational changes and disruptions would be signature traits of Borlo&#39;s piracy but may require some digging to realize this connection.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 2: Hacked Communications Network</strong>
Mira, the group&#39;s strategist, will inevitably leave traces of her hacks in the communication networks of the transports. These anomalies in the data traffic might initially go unnoticed due to the vast amount of daily interstellar communication. But their persistence around the incidents of piracy would eventually alert someone keen on pattern recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 3: Weapon Residue from Pirate Attacks</strong>
From physical confrontations during the ongoing pirate attacks, residue from the heavy weaponry may often be left behind. Among these, traces of the Grell-specific weaponry used by Graak could be an intriguing find. It&#39;s common knowledge that Grell are not often involved in piracy, and such an anomaly could make someone dig deeper into these incidents. </p>
<p><strong>Clue 4: Abnormal Activity in the Uncharted Region</strong>
The uncharted region where Borlo and his crew retreat after their operations might also draw some attention. As successful heists increase, activity in this once-quiet region would spike. If the players or any vigilant parties map out these unusual activities, they might find the pirate hideout or at least suspect there&#39;s something worth investigating in the area.</p></main></article><article id="40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_40_interested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Interested Parties</h1><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate">Captain Borlo Pirate</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_40_interested_parties">Interested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1. Stellar Security Bureau (SSB):</strong> This is a large intergalactic law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining peace and security across known space. They would be very interested in cracking down on Borlo&#39;s operation and bringing the notorious pirate to justice. Once they learn about the disrupted warp drive routes and the other clues, they would likely dedicate substantial resources to solve the case and apprehend the criminals.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Torelli Mining Company:</strong> As the primary company that operates in the mining colonies on Yshlok Planet, the Torelli Mining Co. has a vested interest in ensuring its supply lines remain uninterrupted. Any disruption to the transportation of their goods and resources would surely attract their attention, and they might hire external mercenaries or private investigators to look into this issue if they feel authorities are not doing enough.</p>
<p><strong>3. Habitation Ring Residents:</strong> Many of the residents on the Medina ring would be directly affected by the ongoing disruptions, as many of them are connected to the trades along these warp drive routes. The longer the problem persists, the more likely it is that individuals or groups from the ring would start their own investigations or protests.</p>
<p><strong>4. Alien Syndicates:</strong> The space routes in and out of Medina-99 are also critical to several Interstellar Syndicates. Forged from alliances between different criminal groups of various alien races, they, too, rely on these routes for their shadowy activities. They may not care about the goods being pirates, but stability is vital for their operations, and a notorious pirate like Borlo wreaking havoc is bad for business. Be it hiring assassins, bounty hunters, or dealing with Banes personally, these syndicates won&#39;t stand idle for long.</p>
<p><strong>5. Rival Pirate Groups:</strong> Superiority and control over the prime piracy zones are often contested among the space pirates, and Borlo&#39;s increased activities might irk other pirate groups. They might consider this as trespassing their &#39;turf&#39; and could interfere with Borlo&#39;s piracy or even go as far as such a notorious pirate is out of the picture.</p></main></article><article id="40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_50_uninterested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Uninterested Parties</h1><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate">Captain Borlo Pirate</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_50_uninterested_parties">Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1. Harken Rimor, the Informant</strong> (Level - Non-combatant, Aspect - &quot;Spaceport Gossipmonger&quot;)</p>
<p>As a spaceport worker who manages one of the loading docks, he interacts with various people, from spacefarers to transport pilots. As an avid collector of rumors and gossips, Harken knows more than meets the eye. Although usually disinterested in disputes and skirmishes, his vast web of space gossip might provide the keys to unforeseen details and leads.    </p>
<p><strong>2. Plix, the Alien Tech Merchant</strong> (Level - Non-combatant, Aspect - &quot;Genius Gadgeteer&quot;)</p>
<p>As an interstellar trader who visits Medina-99 from time to time selling his wares, Plix is a technical genius from the alien race of Pegasi. His knowledge in highly advanced technology, particularly warp tech, could help understand the warp jamming device used by the pirates. Although usually only focused on making a profit, with the right incentive or a chance to examine rare tech, he could be persuaded to help.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Ikarians</strong> (Level - Varies, Aspect - &quot;Isolationist Alien Society&quot;)</p>
<p>The Ikarians are an advanced and peaceful alien society neighboring the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station region. Although they usually remain uninterested in the affairs of other societies and races, their superior surveillance tech and extensive knowledge of galaxy&#39;s uncharted regions could be invaluable. Convincing them could pose a delicate diplomatic challenge, requiring respectful and skillful negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>4. Eve &quot;Ether&quot; Catton</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Smarts, Aspect - &quot;Retired Interstellar Hacker&quot;)</p>
<p>Eve, an ex-hacker turned ethical cyber security consultant, knows her way around any digital system or network you throw at her. If the hacking signature left by Mira could be obtained, Eve might be able to reverse-engineer the breach and provide valuable information about the pirates. She prefers a quiet life now, but a worthy cause or interesting challenge could bring her out of her digital solitude. </p>
<p><strong>5. Veran Guild of Miners - Local Chapter</strong> (Level - Varies, Aspect - &quot;Hard-Working Space Miners&quot;)</p>
<p>As workers on the frontline of space resource extraction, these miners could serve as the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; for the team, alerting them of unusual activities in the asteroid fields where they work, where the pirate&#39;s base might be hiding. Being often overlooked, the miners aren&#39;t usually involved in crime-stopping affairs, but a cunning player could highlight the common threat the pirates pose to their operations and thereby solicit their cooperation.</p></main></article><article id="40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_60_title"><header><nav><h1>Title</h1><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate">Captain Borlo Pirate</a></li><li><a href="#40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_60_title">Title</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>&quot;The Pirates of Medina-99: Struggle for the Stellar Station&quot;</p></main></article></section></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>©2023 David Souther</nav></footer><script src="https://unpkg.com/@davidsouther/jiffies-css/accessibility.js"></script></body></html>
