During the encounter, Uzol the &quot;Juggernaut&quot;, being the frontliner, lost a piece of his custom-made armor plating.</p>
<p>This piece of armor is unique and distinctive, made from a rare alloy only found in the mining colonies of the harsh Yshlok Planet, a place known for high criminal activities and brute labor camps. The armor piece also bears the distinctive mark or symbol of the Ironfist pirates, a secret runic design known only to a few in the underworld that represents the brutal pirate captain Borlo &quot;The Ironfist&quot; Banes. </p>
<p>This bit of armor might seem just a piece of junk at first, but to those knowledgeable in the galaxy&#39;s murkier dealings, it&#39;s a clue that an infamously ruthless pirate crew has set their sights on the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station of Medina-99. This would certainly spark an investigation by the detectives who patrol the habitation ring, as the safety and peace of their home turf are being threatened.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>Â©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
