The Silver Foxes are considered captains in NPC levels. They are led by their wily leader Captain Doris with a Good Skill for smuggling and an Average Grit, and she boasts the aspects &quot;Crafty as a Fox&quot; and &quot;Reformed? Maybe.&quot;. She is ably assisted by Lieutenant Basil who has an Average Smarts and an Average Cool, with the aspect &quot;Keeps His Head When Others Don&#39;t&quot;. </p>
<p>The plan is simple; The Silver Foxes will use their old smuggling routes to covertly transport the space llamas from the space Machu Picchu to Medina-99. Once there, The Knitting Grannies will shear the llamas and weave their wool into warmer suits for the frigid temperatures of their home. </p>
<p>Once the wool is used, the space llamas will then be delivered to various animal loving patrons who have no idea of the plot, thus providing the Silver Foxes with a good income and freeing space for new llamas. This also helps to avoid any possible suspicion as the llamas will not be killed or abused, merely sheared and given to new homes.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_10_accomplices_and_plan --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Space Llamas</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Next: Clue</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_20_clue (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_20_clue"><header><nav><h1>Clue</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas">Space Llamas</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_20_clue">Clue</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>A shipment of llama wool was mistakenly delivered to the local Medina-99 Sci-Fi and Comic Book club instead of the infamous knitting grannies. The comic book club was expecting a shipment of replica superhero capes for their annual Cos-Medina-Con.</p>
<p>The llama wool was encased in a special protective cover for the transport, clearly labeled &#39;Space Llama Wool - Handle With Care&#39;. This anomaly piqued the interest of our hero detectives, who were notified by the Comic Book Club&#39;s president, a non-combatant NPC named Gabby Geek who has the aspect &quot;Has an Eye For Detail and An Ear For Trouble&quot;.</p>
<p>This mistake provided our detectives with the possibility of a connection between the prized space llamas of space Machu Picchu and Medina-99, something not ordinarily seen in suburban space life. As a result, the detectives will be inclined to manage this situation and will begin conducting investigations and analyzing the links.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_30_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_30_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas">Space Llamas</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_30_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>If the players choose not to intervene immediately, they will encounter a cascade of inconsequential yet highly noticeable anomalies:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A slight increase in exotic pet purchases: As the llamas are sheared and then sold to innocent buyers, there&#39;s a sudden influx of space llamas appearing all over Medina-99. People begin discussing llamas as the new &quot;rage&quot; in house pets, and the unexpected popularity even makes a blip on the local news stations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unusual llama wool products in the market: The knitting grannies start to sell incredibly warm products made from the llama wool. This may come to the player&#39;s attention when they notice everyone using and praising the startling effectiveness of these warm scarves and mittens. Inspection of these products will reveal they&#39;re made from space llama wool, which is very unusual for the Medina market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Old Smuggling Routes reopening: Local space truckers and pilots might start sharing rumors in bars and lounges about long-abandoned smuggling routes suddenly seeing traffic again. They might even joke about the &quot;Silver Foxes making a comeback&quot;. This could be added onto chatter the players overhear or get reported to them if they have connections among pilots or use Smarts to gain this info.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overheard gossip from the grannies: The knitting grannies, considering they are mostly innocuous, might reveal parts of their operation unknowingly. Perhaps a snippet of conversation overheard in the local park about &#39;how the new wool deliveries are such a lifesaver&#39; or one granny proudly showing off a picture on her communicator of a freshly sheared space llama to her friends while at a public café.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these clues serve to solidify the operation of a vast wool collection and distribution network, centered around the highly prized (and previously thought secure) space llamas. The players&#39; challenge will be piecing together these seemingly unrelated socioeconomic shifts and tracing them back to the guilty grannies and their sneaky silver-haired accomplices.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_40_interested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_40_interested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Interested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas">Space Llamas</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_40_interested_parties">Interested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><ol>
<li><p>The Galactic Llama Rescue Society (GLRS): A group of dedicated animal welfare activists led by Captain Roberto &quot;Bob&quot; O&#39;Hara might be interested in investigating the sudden spike in llama pet ownership. His attributes include Good Smarts and Average Skills in animal rescue. His guiding aspects are &quot;Man&#39;s best friend comes in all forms&quot; and &quot;Doing it for the animals&quot;. They might become allies of the players if they are convinced about the illicit llama shearing operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rogue trader Shava &quot;The Shark&quot; Johannson: A lieutenant-ranked individual who is known for dealing exotic animal products. Her attributes are an Average Muscle and Skill in trading. She isn&#39;t happy about other traders entering her territory, and may try to sabotage their operations, hinting at the Silver Foxes involvement. She carries the aspect &quot;I didn&#39;t claw my way up by sharing my pie&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Space Machu Picchu Tourism Board: A slight dip in llama sightings impact their touristic appeal, forcing them to take notice. A non-combatant NPC representative of the board, Manuel Pacha, an Average Grit official with the aspect &quot;Passionately protective of the tourism revenue&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cosmic Fiber Confederacy: A somewhat mysterious and innocuous group of yarn aficionados who see the knitting grannies elevated products as unfair competition. They might want to put a stop to the Grannies&#39; operation, possibly by hiring a detective. They are led by Lydia, a non-combatant NPC with the aspect &quot;Wool is life, life is wool&quot;.</p>
</li>

<p>These interested parties provide possible allies, antagonists, as well as informational and resource avenues for the players as they navigate this &quot;hair-raising&quot; crime. They could also provide additional side quests or challenges depending on how the players interact with them.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_40_interested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Previous: Plot</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Next: Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_50_uninterested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_50_uninterested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Uninterested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas">Space Llamas</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_50_uninterested_parties">Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><ol>
<li><p>The Dockers Union: Led by a down-to-earth Captain named Harry &quot;Big Hand&quot; Davis, he has a background in freight handling with a Good Skill in Management and an Average Grit. His aspects are &quot;From the Docks to the Stars&quot; and &quot;Always Help A Broke Down Rig&quot;. He might not particularly care about the llama wool smuggling until it becomes a problem within his docks. The players could convince him to keep tabs on unusual shipments, given his extensive networks. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Quantum Fiber Tech Corporation (QFTC): Specializing in the creation of synthetic fibers for spacesuits and daily wear, they might have an interest if the llama wool production is revealed to be tied to their business. A mid-level executive, Lieutenant Jane Papyrus with an Average Smarts and Skill in Technology and the aspect &quot;Never Met a Problem Technology Couldn&#39;t Solve&quot; could be approached for analysis and cross-referencing with their own fiber materials.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Academics at the Medinian Institute of Zoology (MIZ): They might be too engrossed in their research to worry about illicit wildlife trafficking, but their immense knowledge and resources could prove beneficial. One of their researchers, Sergeant Dr. Winston Tharpe, having an Average Cool and the aspect &quot;Absent-Minded Professor&quot;, could be convinced to aid the players in better understanding the peculiarities of space llamas.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Space-Time Mall Retailers: Particularly those specializing in selling exotic pet accessories might unknowingly be involved in providing gear for the new space llama owners. The players can visit these stores for information about sudden bulk purchases or specific customers. One helpful retail worker, Mook-level Myrtle &quot;Cash Counter&quot; Cadence with a Poor Smarts and the aspect &quot;Likes Gossip More than Sales&quot; might prove more helpful than expected.</p>
</li>

<p>These uninterested parties could become invaluable sources of information, resources or aid in the players&#39; quest to uncover and dismantle the knitted network of crime, based on how well the players can engage and convince them.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_50_uninterested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Previous: Interested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./60_title.html">Next: Title</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_60_title (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_60_title"><header><nav><h1>Title</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas">Space Llamas</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_60_space_llamas_60_title">Title</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>&quot;Unspun: The Llama Wool Mysteries&quot;</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_60_title --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Previous: Uninterested Parties</a></li><li></li></ol></nav></footer></article><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_60_space_llamas --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="../50_general_vendrix_politics/60_title.html">Previous: Title</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Next: Accomplices And Plan</a></li></ol></nav></footer></section></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
