<ol>
<li><p>A slight increase in exotic pet purchases: As the llamas are sheared and then sold to innocent buyers, there&#39;s a sudden influx of space llamas appearing all over Medina-99. People begin discussing llamas as the new &quot;rage&quot; in house pets, and the unexpected popularity even makes a blip on the local news stations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unusual llama wool products in the market: The knitting grannies start to sell incredibly warm products made from the llama wool. This may come to the player&#39;s attention when they notice everyone using and praising the startling effectiveness of these warm scarves and mittens. Inspection of these products will reveal they&#39;re made from space llama wool, which is very unusual for the Medina market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Old Smuggling Routes reopening: Local space truckers and pilots might start sharing rumors in bars and lounges about long-abandoned smuggling routes suddenly seeing traffic again. They might even joke about the &quot;Silver Foxes making a comeback&quot;. This could be added onto chatter the players overhear or get reported to them if they have connections among pilots or use Smarts to gain this info.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overheard gossip from the grannies: The knitting grannies, considering they are mostly innocuous, might reveal parts of their operation unknowingly. Perhaps a snippet of conversation overheard in the local park about &#39;how the new wool deliveries are such a lifesaver&#39; or one granny proudly showing off a picture on her communicator of a freshly sheared space llama to her friends while at a public café.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these clues serve to solidify the operation of a vast wool collection and distribution network, centered around the highly prized (and previously thought secure) space llamas. The players&#39; challenge will be piecing together these seemingly unrelated socioeconomic shifts and tracing them back to the guilty grannies and their sneaky silver-haired accomplices.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_60_space_llamas_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
