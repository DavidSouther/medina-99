Tormin &#39;Tor&#39; Gadra</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Toughness, +1 Skill (Investigation), Aspects - &quot;Streetwise Union Leader&quot;)
Tormin Gadra is the leader of the worker&#39;s union in the Medina Ring. He&#39;s noted that the decrease in work quality is endangering his workers and raising safety concerns across the decks. While he isn&#39;t sure what&#39;s causing it, he&#39;s determined to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Alara Zi</strong> (Level - Soldier, Attributes - +1 Smarts, Aspect - &quot;Dedicated Journalist&quot;)
Alara Zi, an investigative reporter, has caught wind of the ongoing corruption. She&#39;s noticed the sudden upliftment of wealth among certain individuals and is determined to shine a light on whatever is happening, even if the dangers associated with such an expose are imminent.</p>
<p><strong>3. Qwex, The Off-World Investor</strong> (Level - General, Attributes - +2 Skill (Management), +2 Smarts, Aspects - &quot;Calculated Business Being&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Agenda&quot;)
Qwex is an alien entrepreneur with significant investments in the station&#39;s trade operations. The increasing irregularities and lowered performance are harming profit. Suspicious, Qwex is conducting an independent investigation to root out the corruption. However, they might hold a hidden agenda of their own.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Station AI, CALIBR</strong> (Level - Non-combatant, Aspect - &quot;Station AI Protocol&quot;)
As the transfer station&#39;s controlling artificial intelligence, CALIBR is programmed to ensure efficient and safe operations of the station. It&#39;s noticing abnormalities but protocol dictates it cannot act on hunches - it needs substantial evidence to inform the administrators or initiate countermeasures.</p>
<p><strong>5. Dani Kl&#39;aire</strong> (Level - Captain, Attributes - +2 Cool, +1 Toughness, Aspects - &quot;Intrepid Station Guard Captain&quot;, &quot;On Vendrix&#39;s Tail&quot;)
Dani is a captain of the station guards who has always been suspicious of Vendrix&#39;s sudden surge to power. Unbeknownst to Vendrix, Kl&#39;aire started a secret task force to investigate her activities. They&#39;d willingly ally with anyone trying to uncover Vendrix&#39;s corruption.</p>
<p>Each of these parties have their own reasons for wanting to uncover Vendrix&#39;s crimes and could serve as allies or resources to the players. Players could also conflict with these parties, depending on the choices they make during their investigation.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_40_interested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Previous: Plot</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Next: Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>Â©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
