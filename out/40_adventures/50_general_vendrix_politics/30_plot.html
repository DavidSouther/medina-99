<ol>
<li><p><strong>Sudden Wealth:</strong> Lesser officials and contractors suddenly affording high-end luxuries could hint at the bribe culture initiated by Xaela Vendrix. This would draw attention from vigilant detectives who notice these inexplicable and irregular discrepancies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Changes in Station Operation:</strong> Increased instances of operational hiccups, substandard goods and services, and a gradual decline in the station&#39;s efficiency and safety could be traced back to Xaela&#39;s manipulations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Digital Irregularities:</strong> Tech-savvy characters may pick up on anomalies within the station&#39;s data systems - unauthorized access, information alteration, and money trails that just don&#39;t add up. These could lead back to Lieutenant Korin Zef.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Intimidation &amp; Violence:</strong> Gen Bova&#39;s rough handling of people unwilling to cooperate may draw the attention of detectives. A string of complaints about threats, assaults, or strong-arm tactics could have Bova&#39;s name repeatedly popping up, revealing his role as an enforcer and making them suspicious.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Suspicion among Staff:</strong> The station&#39;s staff may show signs of unease or fear, with some maybe even trying to approach the detectives covertly to express their worries about the new order of things.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, these clues are not laid out like breadcrumbs for players. Each clue must be pushed further into the narrative as the consequences of the villain&#39;s plot start to affect the station more severely. This way, players feel the urgency increasing if they do not act or solve the puzzle in time.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>Â©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
