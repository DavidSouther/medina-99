<ol>
<li><p><strong>Captain Tessier Bray</strong> (Level - Captain, Attributes - +2 Skill (Management), +1 Cool, Aspects - &quot;Unquestioning Loyalty&quot; and &quot;Deceptive Facade&quot;)- Tessier is Vendrix&#39;s second-in-command, managing her illegal transactions and operations while maintaining plausible deniability for himself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lieutenant Korin Zef</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Smarts, +1 Skill (Technology), Aspects - &quot;Sneaky Tech Expert&quot;)- Zef is responsible for hacking into systems, erasing digital footprints and misdirecting anyone investigating Vendrix or her dealings.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sergeant Gen Bova</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Toughness, Aspects - &quot;Unknowingly Conflicted&quot;)- Gen is an enforcer in Xaela&#39;s team, often made to act against his conscience without realizing the full extent of his involvement in the Corruption.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Plan:</strong></p>
<p>Xaela is using her power to channel and manipulate the finances of the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station to their advantage. Through Bray, she has made various shady deals, bribing officials, contractors, and businesses into inflating prices or cutting corners, and pocketing the difference. Zef is key to all digital aspects, responsible for intercepting, modifying, or fabricating digital records. Meanwhile, Gen is used for strong-arming those who won&#39;t cooperate or suspect foul play.</p>
<p>The villain&#39;s primary plan is to continue these operations indefinitely, accumulating wealth and influence. She also seeks to abuse her authority to extend her control over more of the station&#39;s operations. As a secondary goal, she is working to steadily erode the checks and balances that might expose her. Ultimately, she aims to rule over the transfer station as her own personal fiefdom. However, the clock is ticking as whispers and suspicions of her corruption are beginning to spread among the station&#39;s inhabitants and law enforcement officials.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_10_accomplices_and_plan --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Next: Clue</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_20_clue (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_20_clue"><header><nav><h1>Clue</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics">Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_20_clue">Clue</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>The leftover clue:</strong></p>
<p>As a result of one of their corrupt deals, there was an accident - a supply shipment to the artifial gravity generator was substituted with substandard materials to cut corners and create a surplus for Xaela and her accomplices. Anyone investigating the incident would initially believe that it was simply due to negligence or cost-cutting. </p>
<p>However, the players come across an anomaly - a data pad left at the scene by accident - belonging to one of Bray&#39;s subordinates. This data pad contains encrypted communications that hint at deliberate sabotage and also mention a meeting occurrence - the details of which are cleverly hidden behind codewords. </p>
<p>The codewords reference seemingly innocuous acts but might seem out of place or suspicious - &#39;feeding the fish,&#39; &#39;taking out the trash&#39;, &#39;paying the landlord.&#39; These could be initial leads for the players to start unraveling the plot. </p>
<p>This data pad clue should intrigue players. They would need to decrypt the anomaly, understand the codewords, and eventually link it to the larger corruption scheme headed by General Xaela Vendrix.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_30_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_30_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics">Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_30_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>Potential new clues:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Sudden Wealth:</strong> Lesser officials and contractors suddenly affording high-end luxuries could hint at the bribe culture initiated by Xaela Vendrix. This would draw attention from vigilant detectives who notice these inexplicable and irregular discrepancies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Changes in Station Operation:</strong> Increased instances of operational hiccups, substandard goods and services, and a gradual decline in the station&#39;s efficiency and safety could be traced back to Xaela&#39;s manipulations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Digital Irregularities:</strong> Tech-savvy characters may pick up on anomalies within the station&#39;s data systems - unauthorized access, information alteration, and money trails that just don&#39;t add up. These could lead back to Lieutenant Korin Zef.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Intimidation &amp; Violence:</strong> Gen Bova&#39;s rough handling of people unwilling to cooperate may draw the attention of detectives. A string of complaints about threats, assaults, or strong-arm tactics could have Bova&#39;s name repeatedly popping up, revealing his role as an enforcer and making them suspicious.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Suspicion among Staff:</strong> The station&#39;s staff may show signs of unease or fear, with some maybe even trying to approach the detectives covertly to express their worries about the new order of things.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, these clues are not laid out like breadcrumbs for players. Each clue must be pushed further into the narrative as the consequences of the villain&#39;s plot start to affect the station more severely. This way, players feel the urgency increasing if they do not act or solve the puzzle in time.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_40_interested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_40_interested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Interested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics">Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_40_interested_parties">Interested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1. Tormin &#39;Tor&#39; Gadra</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Toughness, +1 Skill (Investigation), Aspects - &quot;Streetwise Union Leader&quot;)
Tormin Gadra is the leader of the worker&#39;s union in the Medina Ring. He&#39;s noted that the decrease in work quality is endangering his workers and raising safety concerns across the decks. While he isn&#39;t sure what&#39;s causing it, he&#39;s determined to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Alara Zi</strong> (Level - Soldier, Attributes - +1 Smarts, Aspect - &quot;Dedicated Journalist&quot;)
Alara Zi, an investigative reporter, has caught wind of the ongoing corruption. She&#39;s noticed the sudden upliftment of wealth among certain individuals and is determined to shine a light on whatever is happening, even if the dangers associated with such an expose are imminent.</p>
<p><strong>3. Qwex, The Off-World Investor</strong> (Level - General, Attributes - +2 Skill (Management), +2 Smarts, Aspects - &quot;Calculated Business Being&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Agenda&quot;)
Qwex is an alien entrepreneur with significant investments in the station&#39;s trade operations. The increasing irregularities and lowered performance are harming profit. Suspicious, Qwex is conducting an independent investigation to root out the corruption. However, they might hold a hidden agenda of their own.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Station AI, CALIBR</strong> (Level - Non-combatant, Aspect - &quot;Station AI Protocol&quot;)
As the transfer station&#39;s controlling artificial intelligence, CALIBR is programmed to ensure efficient and safe operations of the station. It&#39;s noticing abnormalities but protocol dictates it cannot act on hunches - it needs substantial evidence to inform the administrators or initiate countermeasures.</p>
<p><strong>5. Dani Kl&#39;aire</strong> (Level - Captain, Attributes - +2 Cool, +1 Toughness, Aspects - &quot;Intrepid Station Guard Captain&quot;, &quot;On Vendrix&#39;s Tail&quot;)
Dani is a captain of the station guards who has always been suspicious of Vendrix&#39;s sudden surge to power. Unbeknownst to Vendrix, Kl&#39;aire started a secret task force to investigate her activities. They&#39;d willingly ally with anyone trying to uncover Vendrix&#39;s corruption.</p>
<p>Each of these parties have their own reasons for wanting to uncover Vendrix&#39;s crimes and could serve as allies or resources to the players. Players could also conflict with these parties, depending on the choices they make during their investigation.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_40_interested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Previous: Plot</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Next: Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_50_uninterested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_50_uninterested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Uninterested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics">Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_50_uninterested_parties">Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1. Zander Quill</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Smarts, +1 Skill (Analysis), Aspect - &quot;Apathetic Genius&quot;)
Zander is a brilliant data analyst and skilled hacker residing on the Medina Ring with no love for station politics. If the players can convince him to help, his skills could prove invaluable for unravelling the digital aspects of Vendrix&#39;s plot.</p>
<p><strong>2. Rilea Tau</strong> (Level - Soldier, Attributes - +1 Skill (Shooting), Aspect - &quot;Ex-military, Reluctant Hero&quot;)
Rilea is a retired security Forces soldier running a small bar on the Medina Ring. She may be brought out of retirement by the plea of helping innocent people caught in Vendrix&#39;s web of corruption.</p>
<p><strong>3. Doctor Elson Vare</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Smarts, Aspects - &quot;Experienced Forensic Pathologist&quot;)
Dr. Vare works at the medical facility on the station. While normally concerned with more immediate health crises, his scientific acumen could provide critical insights into any physical evidence the players may uncover, if they can convince him that his help is necessary. </p>
<p><strong>4. C.H.A.R.L.I.</strong> (Level - Non-combatant, Aspect - &quot;Maintenance AI Bot&quot;)
C.H.A.R.L.I. is an artificial intelligence programmed for routine maintenance and minor repairs throughout the station. Indifferent to any political or criminal issues, it could be repurposed to look for abnormalities or suspicious activities in the station&#39;s systems.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Dockmaster</strong> (Level - Captain, Attributes - +2 Skill (Management), +1 Cool, Aspects - &quot;Seasoned Logistics Expert&quot;, &quot;Unconcerned Non-partisan&quot;)
The Dockmaster oversees the comings and goings of all ships at the station. He could provide much-needed information about suspicious shipments or arrivals, but as a neutral party, the players will need to convince him that his cooperation is for the greater good.</p>
<p>All of these individuals have the resources, skills or knowledge that could help the players in their investigation but might need to be convinced of the importance and urgency of their involvement. This lack of initial interest adds another layer of depth to the narrative and additional roleplay challenges for the players.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_50_uninterested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Previous: Interested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./60_title.html">Next: Title</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_60_title (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_60_title"><header><nav><h1>Title</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics">Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_60_title">Title</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>The title for this adventure is &quot;Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring&quot;.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_60_title --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Previous: Uninterested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="../60_space_llamas/index.html">Next: Space Llamas</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="../40_captain_borlo_pirate/60_title.html">Previous: Title</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Next: Accomplices And Plan</a></li></ol></nav></footer></section></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
