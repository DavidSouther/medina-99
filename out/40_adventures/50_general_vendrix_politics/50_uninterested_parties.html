Zander Quill</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Smarts, +1 Skill (Analysis), Aspect - &quot;Apathetic Genius&quot;)
Zander is a brilliant data analyst and skilled hacker residing on the Medina Ring with no love for station politics. If the players can convince him to help, his skills could prove invaluable for unravelling the digital aspects of Vendrix&#39;s plot.</p>
<p><strong>2. Rilea Tau</strong> (Level - Soldier, Attributes - +1 Skill (Shooting), Aspect - &quot;Ex-military, Reluctant Hero&quot;)
Rilea is a retired security Forces soldier running a small bar on the Medina Ring. She may be brought out of retirement by the plea of helping innocent people caught in Vendrix&#39;s web of corruption.</p>
<p><strong>3. Doctor Elson Vare</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Smarts, Aspects - &quot;Experienced Forensic Pathologist&quot;)
Dr. Vare works at the medical facility on the station. While normally concerned with more immediate health crises, his scientific acumen could provide critical insights into any physical evidence the players may uncover, if they can convince him that his help is necessary. </p>
<p><strong>4. C.H.A.R.L.I.</strong> (Level - Non-combatant, Aspect - &quot;Maintenance AI Bot&quot;)
C.H.A.R.L.I. is an artificial intelligence programmed for routine maintenance and minor repairs throughout the station. Indifferent to any political or criminal issues, it could be repurposed to look for abnormalities or suspicious activities in the station&#39;s systems.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Dockmaster</strong> (Level - Captain, Attributes - +2 Skill (Management), +1 Cool, Aspects - &quot;Seasoned Logistics Expert&quot;, &quot;Unconcerned Non-partisan&quot;)
The Dockmaster oversees the comings and goings of all ships at the station. He could provide much-needed information about suspicious shipments or arrivals, but as a neutral party, the players will need to convince him that his cooperation is for the greater good.</p>
<p>All of these individuals have the resources, skills or knowledge that could help the players in their investigation but might need to be convinced of the importance and urgency of their involvement. This lack of initial interest adds another layer of depth to the narrative and additional roleplay challenges for the players.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_50_uninterested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Previous: Interested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./60_title.html">Next: Title</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>Â©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
