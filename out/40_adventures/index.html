Results, challenges, and attributes are ranked by quality. The quality ranges are</p>
<ul>
<li>-1 Poor</li>
<li>0 Mediocre</li>
<li>+1 Average</li>
<li>+2 Good</li>
<li>+3 Great</li>
</ul>
<p>Characters have Aspects, which are short statements capturing their essential personality traits and background.
Characters have attributes, which indicate how well they perform certain approaches to problem solving.
Attributes have a quality from the scale; if not listed, the quality is 0 Mediocre. The attributes for this setting are</p>
<p>A character may choose three basic skills to invoke as aspects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Analysis involves the critical evaluation of collected data and evidence. Detectives trained in this skill can draw connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of information, use logic and reasoning to deduce motives or predict a perpetrator&#39;s next move, and employ various analytical tools and software to support their findings.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation:</strong> This skill equips detectives with the ability to meticulously search crime scenes to identify and collect evidence. Detectives learn techniques for preserving the integrity of a scene, recognizing signs of foul play, and discerning patterns that might not be immediately obvious. This also involves interviewing witnesses, understanding human behavior, and piecing together a narrative from disparate clues.</li>
<li><strong>Law:</strong> A foundational understanding of the legal system is crucial. Detectives are trained in the legal codes relevant to their jurisdiction, the rights of suspects and citizens, the proper procedures for arrests and searches, and the ethical considerations inherent in law enforcement.</li>
<li><strong>Management:</strong> Effective detectives often work as part of a team or may lead one. This skill teaches them to coordinate resources, delegate tasks based on individual strengths, manage the logistics of an investigation, and ensure that all team members are working cohesively towards a common goal.</li>
<li><strong>Muscle:</strong> This isn&#39;t just about physical strength; it&#39;s about using one&#39;s physical presence and body language to influence situations. Detectives learn techniques in persuasion, intimidation, and non-verbal communication. They&#39;re trained to defuse tense situations, command respect in a room, and, if necessary, use physical force effectively and responsibly.</li>
<li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Detectives learn to design, operate, and repair various robotic devices. This can range from drones used for surveillance to specialized robots that can assist in investigations, like those that might enter hazardous environments or analyze certain types of evidence. Detectives also learn how to defend against potential robotic threats.</li>
<li><strong>Shooting:</strong> Detectives receive comprehensive training in the use and safety of firearms. This includes mastering accuracy, understanding the mechanics and maintenance of various weapons, practicing quick decision-making in shoot/don&#39;t shoot scenarios, and learning the legal and ethical implications of using a firearm.</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> In an age of digital information, detectives need to be adept at using computer systems. This skill covers everything from basic digital research and surveillance to advanced techniques like digital forensics, hacking, and counter-hacking measures.</li>
</ul>
<p>These foundational skills ensure that detectives are versatile, effective, and operate with a combination of intellect, physical ability, and ethical responsibility.</p>
<p>A character may choose one advanced skill to invoke as an aspect.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced Spacecraft Piloting:</strong> While general transportation might be handled by specialized pilots, detectives might need to chase suspects through space or navigate dangerous areas. This course would offer advanced piloting techniques, evasive maneuvers, and understanding of various spacecraft types and their capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Alien Culture and Psychology:</strong> With the mingling of various alien species, understanding their cultural nuances, body language, and psychological tendencies is crucial. This course would teach detectives about the major species they&#39;re likely to encounter, their societal norms, and how to effectively communicate and negotiate with them.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-G Combat Training:</strong> In environments where gravity may be manipulated or non-existent, detectives need specialized training to handle confrontations. This includes understanding movement in a number of gravity environments, utilizing equipment to anchor oneself, and effectively subduing suspects without the aid of gravity.</li>
<li><strong>Stellar Forensics:</strong> Crime scenes in space have unique challenges. This course would delve into advanced techniques for gathering and preserving evidence in various environments, from the vacuum of space to atmospheres different from Earth&#39;s. Detectives would learn about space-specific evidence, like radiation patterns, space debris trajectories, and vacuum exposure effects on organic material.</li>
</ul>
<p>These detectives have received special training from the space police force. What are 12 specific skills a police force on a large space station would offer courses in for their detectives?</p>
<p>When introducing a character, include their level, their attributes that aren&#39;t 0 Mediocre, and aspects describing them.</p>
<p>NPC levels are</p>
<ul>
<li>Non combatant<ul>
<li>all approaches -1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mook two 0 mediocre approaches</li>
<li>Soldier one +1 average approach and 1 -1 poor approach</li>
<li>Sergeant two +1 average approaches one basic skill</li>
<li>Lieutenant one +2 fair and three +1 average approaches two basic skills</li>
<li>Captain one +3 good and two +2 fair approaches two basic and one advanced skill</li>
<li>General two +3 good and three +2 fair approaches three basic and one advanced skills</li>
<li>Big Bad one +4 great and two +2 good and three +1 average approaches and four basic and two advanced skills</li>

That ended abruptly when Oliver, the proprietor, announced that a technical malady had plagued his famed Nubby Stout, morphing it into repulsive Space Natty Light.</p>
<p>Seeing the horror around them, Rob, Gena, and Annie felt compelled to act. Annie, well-versed in the world of technology, ran a quick scan and identified an anomalous Electromagnetic field radiating from behind the bar. The source? A hidden sealed door. Employing Avery&#39;s lock-picking skills, the detectives managed to open the compartment and discovered an antiquated VHS player emitting a strange signal.</p>
<p>While dealing with the sudden curiosity, they inadvertently drew the attention of beat cops from the other precinct. The tension was expertly diffused by Rob, who was no stranger to the delicate dance of cop to cop diplomacy.</p>
<p>Deep into the investigation, it was discovered that the EM waves coincided with the signature of a missing employee, Carl. Worried, they lodged a request with the maintenance department, who, in a classic bureaucratic manner, promised service in about two weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the detectives got a hot tip—there was a pop-up disco event from the far travelers, renowned for their exotic earthly drinks. Rob had a history with the far travelers and managed to strike a conversation with the group who had docked up in the upscale Beta docks. Even amidst the music and dance, the detectives didn&#39;t lose sight of their mission, uncovering the valuable truth that the far travelers sourced their brews from Olympus Mons on Mars.</p>
<p>The disco night also provided an unexpected breakthrough—a kid revealed the purpose of the mysterious VHS player—it was an old cell phone. This seemed to be the missing piece of the puzzle. But just as things seemed to fall in line, the space Natty Light debacle replayed, leading them right back to the start.</p>
<p>This time though, the detectives had a lead. The signal and Olympus Mons&#39; connection led them to Deej&#39;s, a well-known eatery in the town. As the events unfolded, the detectives bravely rallied to catch the culprits in action. Deej’s high-tech security system incapacitated the intruding Rodrac and Rolf, and the detectives successfully made their arrest.</p>
<p>In one fell swoop, the sinister plot to steal Olympus Mons&#39; sausages and corrupt Nubby Stout was foiled. Amidst the ensuing chaos, Gena found time to give a good look to Deej&#39;s stocked bar appreciating the wide array of drink choices—an endearing quality for a space station. The victory was well-earned, and the detectives, having saved the Nubby Stout from an unfortunate fate, settled back into the bar, each nursing their respective drinks, ready to face the next oddity Medina-99 had in store.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_11_nubby_stout_90_journal --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./40_rodrac.html">Previous: Rodrac</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="../12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler/index.html">Next: Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_11_nubby_stout --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_villains_and_plots.html">Previous: Villains And Plots</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./11_nubby_stout/10_hook.html">Next: Hook</a></li></ol></nav></footer></section><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler (links: hash) --><section><header><nav id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler"><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="./index.html">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="./12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler/index.html">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li></ol></nav></header><main><p><strong>Villain: Sergeant Graxx</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Toughness, +1 Muscle, Aspect - &quot;Resilient Alien Brute&quot;)</p>
<ul>
<li>Crime: Smuggling</li>
<li>Goal: Graxx is part of a secretive and deadly alien cartel whose aim is to smuggle illegal psychoactive substances into Medina-99 to corrupt and profit off its wealthy inhabitants. His goal is to establish a firm control over the trade and extend their alien cartel influence in the station.</li>

Yarla is a clever and cunning alien who operates as the main information broker for Graxx&#39;s operations. They are experts in using interstellar communications technology and encrypted data to covertly pass information and ensure the safe delivery of smuggled substances.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplice 2: Captain Zukor</strong> (Level - Captain, Attributes - +2 Skill (Investigation), +1 Smarts, Aspects - &quot;Dogged Detective, Unwitting Pawn&quot;)
Zukor is a dedicated detective with the Medina-99 police department who&#39;s been manipulated by Graxx and Yarla into hinderance. Zukor&#39;s dedication makes him an ideal pawn. His critical investigations sometimes throw off the cop&#39;s trails just when they start getting too close.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplice 3: General Klynn</strong> (Level - General, Attributes -+2 Grit, +2 Cool, Aspects - &quot;Ice Cold Enforcer, Ruthless Strategist&quot;)
Klynn is a powerful and ruthless strategist. He ensures that Graxx&#39;s plans are implemented smoothly and take care of any major obstacles that come their way. He also works to ensure that Graxx&#39;s influence continues to spread through fear and intimidation.</p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong>
The plan is simple yet effective. Graxx controls the supply of illegal substances while Yarla coordinates the smuggling and communication operations. All the dealings are disguised under legitimate trade or shipping endeavours making it difficult for anyone to discern the true nature of their operations.</p>
<p>Captain Zukor, though unintentionally, plays a crucial role in this plan. Any time the detectives start sniffing around, Zukor&#39;s hunches and investigations manage to steer them away, often attributing the increase in drug trade to local gangs or rival cartels.</p>
<p>General Klynn serves as the enforcer and strategist, ensuring that Graxx&#39;s plans are carried out and that their expanding influence is kept secure through a mix of covert threats and force, maintaining the balance of fear that keeps the operation hidden and profitable.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_10_accomplices_and_plan --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Next: Clue</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_20_clue (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_20_clue"><header><nav><h1>Clue</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_20_clue">Clue</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>The clue they left behind is a peculiar device: an alien Data-Tab.

As the smuggling operations expand, more and more alien technology starts popping up in the marketplace. Some of these items, while seemingly harmless, have unique properties or rare components that aren&#39;t known to commonly be available in Medina-99. This influx of alien technology could point investigators towards broader operations involving alien criminals.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 3: The Uncommon Psychoactive Substances</strong>
These substances are not native to the Sol system, providing another clue to the players about the extent of the smuggling operation. Local law enforcement and medical professionals begin to report cases of citizens affected by this alien substance in strange ways --based on symptoms, this is clearly not a common Earth-origin drug.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 4: Zukor&#39;s Misdirection</strong>
If the players pay attention, they might notice a pattern in Zukor&#39;s investigations always leading away from where the action is. While Zukor is genuinely trying to solve the cases, his dogged pursuit of incomplete leads is questionable. The heroes might start investigating why he&#39;s always leading them astray.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 5: Increase in Intimidation and Obscure Threats</strong>
As Graxx and Klynn push to maintain control over their operation, there will be an uptick in obscure threats and intimidation against potential competitors and anyone who gets too close to the truth. This shows in increased &#39;accidental&#39; systems failures, threats disguised as freak accidents to those snooping too close, and a general atmosphere of fear among those in the know.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if the players are observant, they will be led to unravel the complex web of this smuggling operation and reveal the major players behind it.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_40_interested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_40_interested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Interested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_40_interested_parties">Interested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>Party 1: Astra Corporation</strong>
Astra Corporation is a powerful and influential entity within the interstellar commercial sector. Their interests lie in maintaining their dominance in the market. The influx of illegal substances and alien technologies is creating an instability that they do not appreciate. Unafraid to get their hands dirty, they may leverage their vast financial and technological resources to interfere, becoming an unexpected ally, or a roadblock to the heroes, depending on their own corporate interests.</p>
<p><strong>Party 2: Commandant Rashida Vega</strong>
Commandant Vega heads the Security Department at the Medina-99 station. She has taken note of the rise in mysterious incidents and alien drug-related issues. Determined to maintain peace and order, she might be interested in forming an alliance with the detectives or might demand they hand over their investigations to her department, causing bureaucratic headaches for them.</p>
<p><strong>Party 3: The Pyxis Outfit</strong>
A rival smuggling cartel, the Pyxis outfit, is also interested in the rising tide of alien narcotics in Medina-99. Recognizing the foreign artifact as an unfamiliar alien cartel&#39;s signature, they might either attempt to muscle in on the operation or try to identify and eliminate the competition. They can just as easily be a hindrance or a lead depending on how the players interact with them.</p>
<p><strong>Party 4: Endangered Alien Species</strong>
The alien species that the harvesting of the psychoactive substance is affecting. Not many outside the cartel are aware, but the substances that Graxx smuggles originates from a sentient flora on an alien world - a fact that would enrage galactic environmentalists and the sentient flora&#39;s protectors. If this information ever got out, it could cause massive public relations and legal issues for Graxx and his cartel.</p>
<p><strong>Party 5: Independent Investigative Journalist</strong>
A journalism entity, possibly in the form of an independent investigative journalist or an avant-garde news network has also taken an interest in the unusual disturbances on the station. They might pursue leads aggressively, possibly getting into the way of both the criminals and the investigators, or they could be a source of information and public awareness. Depending on how the players frame their own investigation, this entity can either be a partner in their investigation or a nuisance revealing details prematurely.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_40_interested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Previous: Plot</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Next: Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_50_uninterested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_50_uninterested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Uninterested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_50_uninterested_parties">Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>Party 1: Dr. Elaina Hawthorne</strong> (Level – Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Smarts, +1 Skill (Analysis), Aspect – “Brilliant Xenobiologist”)
Dr. Hawthorne is a xenobiologist stationed at Medina-99. She has extensive knowledge about alien species and technologies, and could therefore help decrypt the alien Data-Tab or analyze the unique psychoactive substances. While she is primarily focused on her research and doesn’t concern herself with station politics or criminal activities, she does value scientific discovery and could be convinced to help in the name of further knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Party 2: Enzo &#39;Ziggy&#39; Zanetti</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Good (Technology), Aspect - &quot;Reclusive Technowizard&quot;)
Ziggy is an eccentric recluse who lives in one of the quieter sectors of the Medina-99 station, known for being a genius with anything tech-related. His skills and knowledge could be very useful in solving the mystery of the Data-Tab and any other technological clues the players might come across. Ziggy doesn&#39;t care for politics or crime, but he has a soft spot for a technical challenge and could be persuaded to lend his expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Party 3: Commander Assil Lohar</strong> (Level – Captain, Attributes - +2 Cool, +1 Grit, Aspects - &quot;Stoic Spacer, Experienced Negotiator&quot;)
Commander Lohar is a highly respected figure in the interstellar ships&#39; docking and freight management. He has a wide range of real-time information about ships coming in and out of the station and their cargo. He has his hands full just making sure the station operates smoothly, but if the crime became a threat to logistics, he might be persuaded to help, or at least provide useful information.</p>
<p><strong>Party 4: Astera Guild of Artificers</strong> (Level – General, Attributes - +2 Skill (Analysis), +2 Smarts, Aspects - &quot;Guardians of Ancient Knowledge, Mysterious and Neutral&quot;)
The Astera Guild is an organization of artisans, inventors, and researchers with vast knowledge of both ancient and cutting-edge technology. They are disinterested in mundane crimes, but the unusual technology associated with the alien drug might intrigue them. They could be a valuable resource, providing important information or analysis to the players. Their help won&#39;t come easily though, the players would need to negotiate or trade something of equal value.</p>
<p><strong>Party 5: Brother Levik</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Cool, +1 Skill (Investigation), Aspect - &quot;Wise Old Bartender&quot;)
Brother Levik runs &quot;Levik&#39;s Last Light,&quot; a popular watering hole on Medina-99, where people from all walks of life come to unwind. Levik has a knack for listening and has an ear to the pulse of the station, he knows all the local rumors and gossip. Levik might not want to get involved, but with his access to station gossip and rumours, he might provide the players with invaluable insights indirectly.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_50_uninterested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Previous: Interested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./60_title.html">Next: Title</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_60_title (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_60_title"><header><nav><h1>Title</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_60_title">Title</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>&quot;The Ring of Shadows: Deception at Medina-99.&quot;</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_60_title --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Previous: Uninterested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="../20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal/index.html">Next: Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./11_nubby_stout/90_journal.html">Previous: Journal</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler/10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Next: Accomplices And Plan</a></li></ol></nav></footer></section><!-- Section _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal (links: hash) --><section><header><nav id="_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal"><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="./index.html">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="./20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal/index.html">Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li></ol></nav></header><main><p><strong>Villain: Mistress Zephira</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Smarts, +1 Technology, Aspect - &quot;Mysterious Hacktivist&quot;)</p>

<p>Vox will firstly sabotage the Transfer Station&#39;s internal surveillance system, making it blind to their digital and physical intrusions. Then, Vox and Plex would infiltrate the digital security, bypassing layers of high-level encryptions to establish a safe and stable connection for Zephira.</p>
<p>Once in the system, Zephira would download as much confidential information as possible and safely leak it to the public, thereby exposing the corruption and manipulation of politics on Medina-99.

The glitch was short-lived but extensive and most people brushed it off as a power surge or system maintenance. However, amid the chaos of the glitch, several encrypted files were accidentally and momentarily made public. </p>
<p>These files contained seemingly a series of cryptic numbers, letters, and symbols that ostensibly made no sense to the common viewer. However, those well-versed in advanced cryptography and network systems might notice that these seemingly random sequences are actually fragments of an incredibly intricate and advanced hacking code, far beyond the capabilities of any average cyber-criminal on Medina-99.</p>

Here’s what the team might unintentionally leave behind:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Suspicious Energy Consumption</strong>: The server rooms in the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station might experience inexplicably high energy draws due to Zephira and Vox&#39;s hacking activities. This might cause the station&#39;s temperature control mechanisms to malfunction, raising questions from maintenance teams and savvy onlookers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Irrational Behaviour by AI Systems</strong>: Vox&#39;s technopathy would cause AI systems he interacts with to behave strangely. Security protocols, AI-based vending machines, telecommunications, and even the AI of player&#39;s own devices might spout gibberish or exhibit unusual glitches. These odd behaviors, if analyzed, could lead back to their operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Signs of Drone Recon</strong>: Plex&#39;s robotic creations would leave traces of their explorations. Slight damage to duct systems, or more refined robotics components (much like the one from previous operations) might be found at various out-of-reach or restricted locations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Anomalies</strong>: Zephira&#39;s data downloads would inevitably leave digital traces. Some data will show signs of being accessed or copied abnormally. These data anomalies can be picked up by advanced algorithms used for data integrity checks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strange Illness</strong>: Rigel-7 is an alien whose biochemistry isn&#39;t entirely compatible with the human-populated Medina-99. Chronic exposure to his alien biology - an unusual skin cell here, an odd chemical secretion there - may result in mild, unexplainable illnesses in people who frequent areas where Rigel-7 spends a lot of time. Cyber-medical specialists or xenobiologists might make this connection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If investigated closely, these signs would all point towards a well-coordinated operation conducted by entities skilled in hacking, robotics, and bearing an unusually advanced level of power and technology.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./31_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_31_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_31_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal">Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_31_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_31_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Previous: Plot</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_40_interested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_40_interested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Interested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal">Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_40_interested_parties">Interested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1.

If they catch wind of Zephira&#39;s plan, they might either lend her their hidden support, or see her team as rivals, and attempt to sabotage or ride on their coattails to create chaos for their own ends.</p>
<p><strong>4. A&#39;ziri Alliance:</strong> An alien coalition from one of the stellar civilizations. They are interested in maintaining the balance of power. The Alliance might clandestinely try to aid Zephira in her mission, seeing it as an opportunity to weaken human interstellar corporations.</p>
<p><strong>5. Althea Stormborn:</strong> A renowned investigative journalist from Medina-99 who has been trying to expose corporate corruption for years. Once she stumbles upon Zephira&#39;s leaked info, she might get involved actively, either trying to reach out to Zephira or doing her own parallel investigations to verify the leaked intel.</p>
<p><strong>6. Fortune Security Solutions:</strong> A private security company responsible for the physical and cyber protection of several corporations that are in Zephira’s crosshairs. As they would be held accountable for any security breaches, the company would be interested in stopping the cyber-attacks.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_40_interested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./31_plot.html">Previous: Plot</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Next: Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_50_uninterested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_50_uninterested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Uninterested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal">Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal_50_uninterested_parties">Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1.

<ul>
<li>Crime: Cyber-attacks - Goal: Zephira is a tireless activist in the pursuit of what she calls ‘information freedom.’ That freedom involves hacking into restricted systems and stealing sensitive data. Her ultimate goal is to expose an alleged conspiracy of the interstellar companies manipulating politics on Medina-99.</li>
</ul></main><!-- Section _40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_10_plan (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_10_plan"><header><nav><h1>Plan</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal">Echoes in the Cybershade: The Zephira Incident</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_10_plan">Plan</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>Mistress Zephira&#39;s plan involves several steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Data Theft:</strong> First, she will initiate low-level cyber-attacks using sophisticated malware and hacking techniques to gather sensitive data and confidential communication logs from the databases of the interstellar corporations operating on Medina-99.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis and Distortion:</strong> Once Zephira has her hands on the information, she will analyze it and, where necessary, introduce misinformation or exaggerate implications to make the corporations appear manipulative and corrupt. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Release of Information:</strong> Zephira will periodically release batches of this distorted data and information to the public through anonymous channels. She plans to time the releases to maximize the political impact, such as right before key elections or corporate board meetings.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fueling the Dissent:</strong> As the revelations from the data leaks cause public outrage, Zephira plans to covertly fuel protests and demonstrations to create instability in the station&#39;s peace. This will involve mobilizing online communities and providing resources to on-the-ground protest movements.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Final Blow:</strong> Once the corporations&#39; power is weakened due to the public backlash and unrest, Zephira plans to launch a massive cyber-attack against their systems, causing widespread dysfunction and chaos. She hopes this will prompt a crackdown by the authorities, further feeding the public outrage and leading to a revolution on Medina-99.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Aftermath:</strong> The ultimate goal of Zephira&#39;s plan is to depose the current corporate-dominated system, leaving a power vacuum which she believes will lead to a more egalitarian society. However, she&#39;s also aware that she might inadvertently make way for more radical elements who could seize this opportunity for their own ends.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To implement her plan, Zephira will need to act stealthily and keep the detectives preoccupied. She may set up sub-plots such as fake cyber attacks, propagate rumors of potential terrorist acts, or even set off actual physical threats using her henchmen, all to distract the authorities&#39; attention from her real moves.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_10_plan --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Echoes in the Cybershade: The Zephira Incident</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./11_accomplices.html">Next: Accomplices</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_11_accomplices (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_11_accomplices"><header><nav><h1>Accomplices</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal">Echoes in the Cybershade: The Zephira Incident</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_11_accomplices">Accomplices</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>In executing her complex plan, Mistress Zephira has gathered a group of skilled operatives who support her cause:</p>

While he&#39;s not very skilled in the legal or technological aspects of their operations, his physical prowess and intimidating presence make him an effective enforcer for keeping potential dissenters (and discoverers) in check. (Soldier level with +1 in Muscle and -1 in Law)</p>
<p><strong>2. Silence:</strong> This masked individual is Zephira&#39;s primary hacking accomplice. Silence is a software savant with a knack for disappearing into the digital shadows when danger is near. They are essential for the data theft and cyber-attack aspects of the plan.

<p><strong>3. Zel:</strong> Zel is a master saboteur from a species adept at blending into their surroundings. He is an expert in causing mayhem when needed, using alien tech to trigger disturbances or accidents that draw attention away from Zephira&#39;s true intentions.

<p><strong>1. Global Corporations:</strong> The interstellar corporations, being the primary targets of Zephira&#39;s plan, are inherently interested in stopping her. They have their corporate security teams employed and also hire private investigators to stop the data theft and to contain any potential scandals that might damage their image.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Station Overseer:</strong> The person in charge of the day-to-day operations of the station, the Station Overseer, also has a stake in maintaining peace and order. Increased public unrest and potential revolution are bad for business and stability, and could cause a crisis. </p>
<p><strong>3. Pro-Corporate Politicians:</strong> There are politicians within the station&#39;s government whose campaigns are funded by these corporations. They would be interested in stopping Zephira to protect their backers and their own political futures.</p>
<p><strong>4. Resistance Groups:</strong> There may also be groups resistant to corporate control who see Zephira as a beacon of hope. They would be interested in her success, seeing it as a stepping stone towards their own goals for the station.</p>
<p><strong>5. Independent Media:</strong> Investigative journalists and independent media outlets might be interested in the information leaks, aiming to validate the information and potentially capitalize on the scoops for their own ends. However, they could also play a crucial role in exposing Zephira&#39;s distorted information.</p>
<p><strong>6. Alien Diplomats:</strong> Alien diplomats residing on the station might have interests in the outcome as well. If the corporations are destabilized, the trade and diplomatic agreements could be affected, shifting the balance of power in their favor or disadvantage.</p>
<p>These parties could become allies or further complicate matters for the detectives as they work to investigate and stop Zephira&#39;s plans.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_12_interested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./11_accomplices.html">Previous: Accomplices</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./13_uninterested_parties.html">Next: Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_13_uninterested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_13_uninterested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Uninterested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal">Echoes in the Cybershade: The Zephira Incident</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_21_mistress_zephira_cyber_criminal_13_uninterested_parties">Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>There are several individuals and groups within the sprawling Medina-99 space station who may not be primarily interested in Zephira&#39;s crimes, yet they might still prove helpful to our detectives:</p>

<p><strong>3. Shi’ Karra,  the Space Bar Owner:</strong> The proprietor of the &#39;Stellar Drift&#39;, a popular local bar, Shi&#39; Karra hears a lot of interesting gossip and has a keen sense of reading people. She might provide insights or information over a strong drink.</p>
<p><strong>4. Warehouse Workers Union:</strong> The people who keep the station running smoothly in the background, they might stumble upon or be aware of unusual occurrences that could prove useful to the investigators, especially if they believe it could safeguard their jobs and normalcy. </p>
<p><strong>5. Robotics &amp; AI Research Lab:</strong> While more interested in advancing science than the intricacies of inter-corporate politics, the scientists might assist if approached correctly.

<li><p><strong>The Tip-Off</strong> - Mistress Zephira initiates her plan with a seemingly insignificant cyber-attack, stealing some benign data. The relatively low-level intrusion only hints at what is to come, while drawing the attention of our detectives to her activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Blueprint</strong> - Zephira and her accomplices are planning a series of major data thefts, each more daring and impactful than the last. They are preparing their systems and fine-tuning their applications to ensure success, while the detectives start to piece together the scale of the threat.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Stakeout</strong> - Zephira lays low, observing the reaction of the corporations, the authorities, and the public to her initial move. She&#39;s also keeping a keen eye on the detectives, ready to divert or mislead them as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Smoke Screen</strong> - Zephira releases a carefully curated and distorted batch of stolen data, sparking public outrage and keeping the detectives distracted. Meanwhile, she&#39;s also spreading misleading information about her hacker cell&#39;s location and composition, throwing law enforcement off her trail.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Alibi</strong> - As the detectives start to make progress, Zephira orchestrates a conspicuous high-profile hacking incident traced to a different location at the same time she&#39;s planning her biggest data theft yet. This step not only confuses the investigation but also solidifies her alibi.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Vanishing Act</strong> - The moment she&#39;s been waiting for. After releasing her final, most sensational batch of manipulated information, and delivering her crippling cyber-attack on the corporations, Zephira plans to disappear. Using her exceptional hacking skills, she erases her existence from digital records, leaves no physical trace, and prepares to watch the chaos unfold from her hidden sanctuary.</p>

<p>The Plan: Vaxis plans to use Q7-K-L to coordinate offensive maneuvers with the robotic minions in strategic places around the station. His main focus is to disrupt daily activities, sow fear among the residents and effectively make the station ungovernable using these rogue robotic troops.</p>
<p>While the chaos ensues, Vaxis relies on Coral Indigo&#39;s expertise in technology; Spatial System Hacking, specifically. Coral&#39;s main task is to compromise the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station&#39;s main computer system, creating a diversion for authorities and also enabling Vaxis to gain control over the station&#39;s overall operations. </p>
<p>Once they have control, their plan is to declare Vaxis as the new authority who would then threaten the destruction of the transfer station, if the socioeconomic structures of Medina-99 were not renegotiated to his terms. </p>
<p>The ultimate threat is a stellar core warhead discreetly installed somewhere within the station by Coral, capable of triggering a supernova. Unknown to most, Coral has placed several decoys around the station, ensuring that finding the real device becomes a task nearly impossible amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>Phase 1 - chaos and fear with robotic minions
Phase 2 - take control over the station&#39;s computer system and operations

During her fitting at a discretely located makeshift lab on the ring, the defective board had malfunctioned, heating up and causing a micro-explosion which jettisoned it from the lab&#39;s chute out into the residential sector of the ring.</p>
<p>This circuit board is not your typical board. It&#39;s designed with impressive intricacy and embedded with exotic, valuable tech components. The board, charred and warped from the micro-explosion, landed mysteriously right on the doorstep of a resident&#39;s habi-pod, causing a minor panic among the dwellers.</p>
<p>The board&#39;s unique impact crater, combined with the unusual energy signature it emitted and its strange allure, prompted the residents to call in the authorities - giving our heroes the first taste of something big going down on humble Medina-99.</p>
<p>The mosaic circuit board gives the heroic detectives their first real clue and a tangible piece of evidence to start investigating, who made this? why? where did it come from? Its rich tech detail and rare components offer a piece of a puzzle that just doesn&#39;t fit into the otherwise peaceful suburban ring.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_30_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_30_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist">Robo Terrorist</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_30_robo_terrorist_30_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><ol>
<li><p><strong>Anomalous Robotic Activity</strong>: As Q7-K-L begins to coordinate the rogue robots across the station, there will be a increase in glitches and odd behavior reported in the robotic workforce. These anomalies are both a consequence of Vaxis&#39; use of heavily modified and unsanctioned AI cores, and Q7-K-L&#39;s forceful intervention on the station&#39;s normal bots for reinforcement.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mysterious Power Fluctuations</strong>: As Coral Impacts the station&#39;s operations gradually, there will be unexplained power surges and outages around the Medina ring. Suspicions arise as the energy signatures correspond to unauthorized high-tech devices, which can be traced back to Coral&#39;s actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Distorted Communications</strong>: As Vaxis starts to take control, there will be moments of alarming static interference on public communication frequencies. Some keen listeners might occasionally hear strange coded chatter. This would be related to Vaxis&#39; own encrypted communication system between him, his accomplices, and his robotic minions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A Suspicious Increase in Luxury Imports</strong>: Vaxis has a taste for rare and exotic goods. As he gains more power and control, a vibrant black-market trade of high-end, luxurious items originating from various parts of the sector has been noticed. Luxury goods, especially those that are tech-related, would indicate wealth and power, throwing a fascinating wrinkle to the case for our heroic detectives. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Remnants of a Stellar Core Device</strong>: If the detectives dig deeper and connect the dots, they may eventually discover residues of interstellar-grade explosive materials in unlikely parts of Grell-I-10. These are nothing but the remnants from Coral&#39;s decoy devices, left deliberately to confuse the investigators and lead them away from the location of the actual stellar core warhead.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Corporate Elite</strong>: The high-powered executives and shareholders in the robotics company that dismissed Vaxis may have a keen interest in the outcome. They would want to see Vaxis stopped before his plans come to fruition as a demonstration of his dangerous genius could ruin their business’s reputation, and potential justice for his dismissal would not be palatable either.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Kor&#39;Ra The Alien Crime Lord</strong>: The notorious Kor&#39;Ra would be interested in ensuring that Medina-99 stays quite as it is. This Alien Crime Lord has significant hidden investments running across this stellar hub of civilization. If Vaxis&#39; plan unfolds completely, it could destabilize the economy and have severe repercussions on his under-the-radar operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dr. Ferron Lux</strong>: Dr. Lux is an esteemed roboticist with a personal history with Vaxis, both being in the robotics field. Recently, he&#39;s been working towards creating AI rules and regulations for stellar systems, focusing on safety and ethics. The rogue robotic activity would not only affect residents&#39; opinion on robots but also pose a threat to his life&#39;s work.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Union of Stellar Transport Workers:</strong> If Vaxis takes control over Grell-I-10 Transfer Station, it would cause chaos in the interstellar transport system, impacting the jobs of thousands of workers unified in this union. They would have a vested interest in ensuring normalcy is restored before their livelihoods are jeopardized.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Task Force Spectra:</strong> This Specialized multi-species enforcement division handles high-risk threats across the stellar hub. Although they usually handle larger scale issues, if Vaxis&#39;s plans escalate, they might step in, offering an interesting dynamic and potential support or competition to the players.</p>

She may not be particularly interested in the crime, but the detectives could barter for her cooperation with mutually beneficial conditions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Technomage of Nyaralon</strong>: An eccentric figure obsessed with the mysticism of technology, currently tucked away in the obscure corners of the station.

He doesn’t care much for what goes wrong on the docks or in the corporate halls, but with his local knowledge of the station and his old contacts in the transport business, he could provide the players with a fresh perspective and unexpected ingredients for their investigation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Silk Sirens</strong>: An underground band of hackers who usually remain apolitical and don’t care about what happens above the schematic virtual clouds. But they have the know-how to circumvent high-end security systems, and could prove instrumental if the detectives can convince them to lend their expertise against Coral&#39;s hacks.</p>

During the encounter, Uzol the &quot;Juggernaut&quot;, being the frontliner, lost a piece of his custom-made armor plating.</p>
<p>This piece of armor is unique and distinctive, made from a rare alloy only found in the mining colonies of the harsh Yshlok Planet, a place known for high criminal activities and brute labor camps. The armor piece also bears the distinctive mark or symbol of the Ironfist pirates, a secret runic design known only to a few in the underworld that represents the brutal pirate captain Borlo &quot;The Ironfist&quot; Banes. </p>
<p>This bit of armor might seem just a piece of junk at first, but to those knowledgeable in the galaxy&#39;s murkier dealings, it&#39;s a clue that an infamously ruthless pirate crew has set their sights on the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station of Medina-99. This would certainly spark an investigation by the detectives who patrol the habitation ring, as the safety and peace of their home turf are being threatened.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_30_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_30_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate">Captain Borlo Pirate</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_30_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>Clue 1: Altered Warp Drive Routes</strong>
The team will notice that several warp drive routes have been altered or are experiencing unexplained disruptions. Upon close examination, these routes happen to be the primary ones for transport vehicles carrying valuable resources. The navigational changes and disruptions would be signature traits of Borlo&#39;s piracy but may require some digging to realize this connection.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 2: Hacked Communications Network</strong>
Mira, the group&#39;s strategist, will inevitably leave traces of her hacks in the communication networks of the transports. These anomalies in the data traffic might initially go unnoticed due to the vast amount of daily interstellar communication. But their persistence around the incidents of piracy would eventually alert someone keen on pattern recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 3: Weapon Residue from Pirate Attacks</strong>
From physical confrontations during the ongoing pirate attacks, residue from the heavy weaponry may often be left behind. Among these, traces of the Grell-specific weaponry used by Graak could be an intriguing find. It&#39;s common knowledge that Grell are not often involved in piracy, and such an anomaly could make someone dig deeper into these incidents. </p>
<p><strong>Clue 4: Abnormal Activity in the Uncharted Region</strong>
The uncharted region where Borlo and his crew retreat after their operations might also draw some attention. As successful heists increase, activity in this once-quiet region would spike. If the players or any vigilant parties map out these unusual activities, they might find the pirate hideout or at least suspect there&#39;s something worth investigating in the area.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_40_interested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_40_interested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Interested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate">Captain Borlo Pirate</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_40_interested_parties">Interested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1. Stellar Security Bureau (SSB):</strong> This is a large intergalactic law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining peace and security across known space. They would be very interested in cracking down on Borlo&#39;s operation and bringing the notorious pirate to justice. Once they learn about the disrupted warp drive routes and the other clues, they would likely dedicate substantial resources to solve the case and apprehend the criminals.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Torelli Mining Company:</strong> As the primary company that operates in the mining colonies on Yshlok Planet, the Torelli Mining Co. has a vested interest in ensuring its supply lines remain uninterrupted. Any disruption to the transportation of their goods and resources would surely attract their attention, and they might hire external mercenaries or private investigators to look into this issue if they feel authorities are not doing enough.</p>
<p><strong>3. Habitation Ring Residents:</strong> Many of the residents on the Medina ring would be directly affected by the ongoing disruptions, as many of them are connected to the trades along these warp drive routes. The longer the problem persists, the more likely it is that individuals or groups from the ring would start their own investigations or protests.</p>
<p><strong>4. Alien Syndicates:</strong> The space routes in and out of Medina-99 are also critical to several Interstellar Syndicates. Forged from alliances between different criminal groups of various alien races, they, too, rely on these routes for their shadowy activities. They may not care about the goods being pirates, but stability is vital for their operations, and a notorious pirate like Borlo wreaking havoc is bad for business. Be it hiring assassins, bounty hunters, or dealing with Banes personally, these syndicates won&#39;t stand idle for long.</p>
<p><strong>5. Rival Pirate Groups:</strong> Superiority and control over the prime piracy zones are often contested among the space pirates, and Borlo&#39;s increased activities might irk other pirate groups. They might consider this as trespassing their &#39;turf&#39; and could interfere with Borlo&#39;s piracy or even go as far as such a notorious pirate is out of the picture.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_40_interested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Previous: Plot</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Next: Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_50_uninterested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_50_uninterested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Uninterested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate">Captain Borlo Pirate</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_50_uninterested_parties">Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1.

<p><strong>2. Plix, the Alien Tech Merchant</strong> (Level - Non-combatant, Aspect - &quot;Genius Gadgeteer&quot;)</p>
<p>As an interstellar trader who visits Medina-99 from time to time selling his wares, Plix is a technical genius from the alien race of Pegasi. His knowledge in highly advanced technology, particularly warp tech, could help understand the warp jamming device used by the pirates. Although usually only focused on making a profit, with the right incentive or a chance to examine rare tech, he could be persuaded to help.</p>

<p>The Ikarians are an advanced and peaceful alien society neighboring the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station region. Although they usually remain uninterested in the affairs of other societies and races, their superior surveillance tech and extensive knowledge of galaxy&#39;s uncharted regions could be invaluable. Convincing them could pose a delicate diplomatic challenge, requiring respectful and skillful negotiation.</p>

<p><strong>5. Veran Guild of Miners - Local Chapter</strong> (Level - Varies, Aspect - &quot;Hard-Working Space Miners&quot;)</p>
<p>As workers on the frontline of space resource extraction, these miners could serve as the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; for the team, alerting them of unusual activities in the asteroid fields where they work, where the pirate&#39;s base might be hiding. Being often overlooked, the miners aren&#39;t usually involved in crime-stopping affairs, but a cunning player could highlight the common threat the pirates pose to their operations and thereby solicit their cooperation.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_50_uninterested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Previous: Interested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./60_title.html">Next: Title</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_60_title (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_60_title"><header><nav><h1>Title</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate">Captain Borlo Pirate</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_60_title">Title</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>&quot;The Pirates of Medina-99: Struggle for the Stellar Station&quot;</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate_60_title --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Previous: Uninterested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="../50_general_vendrix_politics/index.html">Next: Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_40_captain_borlo_pirate --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./30_robo_terrorist/60_title.html">Previous: Title</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_captain_borlo_pirate/10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Next: Accomplices And Plan</a></li></ol></nav></footer></section><!-- Section _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics (links: hash) --><section><header><nav id="_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics"><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="./index.html">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="./50_general_vendrix_politics/index.html">Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li></ol></nav></header><main><p><strong>Villain: General Xaela Vendrix</strong> (Level - General, Attributes - +2 Smarts, +2 Law, Aspects - &quot;Corrupt Official&quot; and &quot;Charismatic Manipulator&quot;)</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Plan:</strong></p>
<p>Xaela is using her power to channel and manipulate the finances of the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station to their advantage. Through Bray, she has made various shady deals, bribing officials, contractors, and businesses into inflating prices or cutting corners, and pocketing the difference. Zef is key to all digital aspects, responsible for intercepting, modifying, or fabricating digital records. Meanwhile, Gen is used for strong-arming those who won&#39;t cooperate or suspect foul play.</p>
<p>The villain&#39;s primary plan is to continue these operations indefinitely, accumulating wealth and influence. She also seeks to abuse her authority to extend her control over more of the station&#39;s operations. As a secondary goal, she is working to steadily erode the checks and balances that might expose her. Ultimately, she aims to rule over the transfer station as her own personal fiefdom. However, the clock is ticking as whispers and suspicions of her corruption are beginning to spread among the station&#39;s inhabitants and law enforcement officials.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_10_accomplices_and_plan --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Next: Clue</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_20_clue (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_20_clue"><header><nav><h1>Clue</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics">Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_20_clue">Clue</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>The leftover clue:</strong></p>
<p>As a result of one of their corrupt deals, there was an accident - a supply shipment to the artifial gravity generator was substituted with substandard materials to cut corners and create a surplus for Xaela and her accomplices. Anyone investigating the incident would initially believe that it was simply due to negligence or cost-cutting. </p>
<p>However, the players come across an anomaly - a data pad left at the scene by accident - belonging to one of Bray&#39;s subordinates. This data pad contains encrypted communications that hint at deliberate sabotage and also mention a meeting occurrence - the details of which are cleverly hidden behind codewords. </p>
<p>The codewords reference seemingly innocuous acts but might seem out of place or suspicious - &#39;feeding the fish,&#39; &#39;taking out the trash&#39;, &#39;paying the landlord.&#39; These could be initial leads for the players to start unraveling the plot. </p>
<p>This data pad clue should intrigue players. They would need to decrypt the anomaly, understand the codewords, and eventually link it to the larger corruption scheme headed by General Xaela Vendrix.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_30_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_30_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics">Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_30_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>Potential new clues:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Sudden Wealth:</strong> Lesser officials and contractors suddenly affording high-end luxuries could hint at the bribe culture initiated by Xaela Vendrix. This would draw attention from vigilant detectives who notice these inexplicable and irregular discrepancies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Changes in Station Operation:</strong> Increased instances of operational hiccups, substandard goods and services, and a gradual decline in the station&#39;s efficiency and safety could be traced back to Xaela&#39;s manipulations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Digital Irregularities:</strong> Tech-savvy characters may pick up on anomalies within the station&#39;s data systems - unauthorized access, information alteration, and money trails that just don&#39;t add up. These could lead back to Lieutenant Korin Zef.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Intimidation &amp; Violence:</strong> Gen Bova&#39;s rough handling of people unwilling to cooperate may draw the attention of detectives. A string of complaints about threats, assaults, or strong-arm tactics could have Bova&#39;s name repeatedly popping up, revealing his role as an enforcer and making them suspicious.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Suspicion among Staff:</strong> The station&#39;s staff may show signs of unease or fear, with some maybe even trying to approach the detectives covertly to express their worries about the new order of things.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, these clues are not laid out like breadcrumbs for players. Each clue must be pushed further into the narrative as the consequences of the villain&#39;s plot start to affect the station more severely. This way, players feel the urgency increasing if they do not act or solve the puzzle in time.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_40_interested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_40_interested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Interested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics">Grell-I-10 Conspiracy: Shadows of the Medina Ring</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_50_general_vendrix_politics_40_interested_parties">Interested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>1.

<p>Each of these parties have their own reasons for wanting to uncover Vendrix&#39;s crimes and could serve as allies or resources to the players.

The Dockmaster oversees the comings and goings of all ships at the station. He could provide much-needed information about suspicious shipments or arrivals, but as a neutral party, the players will need to convince him that his cooperation is for the greater good.</p>
<p>All of these individuals have the resources, skills or knowledge that could help the players in their investigation but might need to be convinced of the importance and urgency of their involvement.

<ol>
<li><p>A slight increase in exotic pet purchases: As the llamas are sheared and then sold to innocent buyers, there&#39;s a sudden influx of space llamas appearing all over Medina-99. People begin discussing llamas as the new &quot;rage&quot; in house pets, and the unexpected popularity even makes a blip on the local news stations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unusual llama wool products in the market: The knitting grannies start to sell incredibly warm products made from the llama wool. This may come to the player&#39;s attention when they notice everyone using and praising the startling effectiveness of these warm scarves and mittens. Inspection of these products will reveal they&#39;re made from space llama wool, which is very unusual for the Medina market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Old Smuggling Routes reopening: Local space truckers and pilots might start sharing rumors in bars and lounges about long-abandoned smuggling routes suddenly seeing traffic again. They might even joke about the &quot;Silver Foxes making a comeback&quot;. This could be added onto chatter the players overhear or get reported to them if they have connections among pilots or use Smarts to gain this info.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overheard gossip from the grannies: The knitting grannies, considering they are mostly innocuous, might reveal parts of their operation unknowingly. Perhaps a snippet of conversation overheard in the local park about &#39;how the new wool deliveries are such a lifesaver&#39; or one granny proudly showing off a picture on her communicator of a freshly sheared space llama to her friends while at a public café.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these clues serve to solidify the operation of a vast wool collection and distribution network, centered around the highly prized (and previously thought secure) space llamas.

<li><p>Quantum Fiber Tech Corporation (QFTC): Specializing in the creation of synthetic fibers for spacesuits and daily wear, they might have an interest if the llama wool production is revealed to be tied to their business.

</li>
<li><p>The Academics at the Medinian Institute of Zoology (MIZ): They might be too engrossed in their research to worry about illicit wildlife trafficking, but their immense knowledge and resources could prove beneficial.

</li>
<li><p>Space-Time Mall Retailers: Particularly those specializing in selling exotic pet accessories might unknowingly be involved in providing gear for the new space llama owners. The players can visit these stores for information about sudden bulk purchases or specific customers. One helpful retail worker, Mook-level Myrtle &quot;Cash Counter&quot; Cadence with a Poor Smarts and the aspect &quot;Likes Gossip More than Sales&quot; might prove more helpful than expected.</p>
