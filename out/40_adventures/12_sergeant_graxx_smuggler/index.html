<ul>
<li>Crime: Smuggling</li>
<li>Goal: Graxx is part of a secretive and deadly alien cartel whose aim is to smuggle illegal psychoactive substances into Medina-99 to corrupt and profit off its wealthy inhabitants. His goal is to establish a firm control over the trade and extend their alien cartel influence in the station.</li>

Yarla is a clever and cunning alien who operates as the main information broker for Graxx&#39;s operations. They are experts in using interstellar communications technology and encrypted data to covertly pass information and ensure the safe delivery of smuggled substances.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplice 2: Captain Zukor</strong> (Level - Captain, Attributes - +2 Skill (Investigation), +1 Smarts, Aspects - &quot;Dogged Detective, Unwitting Pawn&quot;)
Zukor is a dedicated detective with the Medina-99 police department who&#39;s been manipulated by Graxx and Yarla into hinderance. Zukor&#39;s dedication makes him an ideal pawn. His critical investigations sometimes throw off the cop&#39;s trails just when they start getting too close.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplice 3: General Klynn</strong> (Level - General, Attributes -+2 Grit, +2 Cool, Aspects - &quot;Ice Cold Enforcer, Ruthless Strategist&quot;)
Klynn is a powerful and ruthless strategist. He ensures that Graxx&#39;s plans are implemented smoothly and take care of any major obstacles that come their way. He also works to ensure that Graxx&#39;s influence continues to spread through fear and intimidation.</p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong>
The plan is simple yet effective. Graxx controls the supply of illegal substances while Yarla coordinates the smuggling and communication operations. All the dealings are disguised under legitimate trade or shipping endeavours making it difficult for anyone to discern the true nature of their operations.</p>
<p>Captain Zukor, though unintentionally, plays a crucial role in this plan. Any time the detectives start sniffing around, Zukor&#39;s hunches and investigations manage to steer them away, often attributing the increase in drug trade to local gangs or rival cartels.</p>
<p>General Klynn serves as the enforcer and strategist, ensuring that Graxx&#39;s plans are carried out and that their expanding influence is kept secure through a mix of covert threats and force, maintaining the balance of fear that keeps the operation hidden and profitable.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_10_accomplices_and_plan --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Next: Clue</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_20_clue (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_20_clue"><header><nav><h1>Clue</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_20_clue">Clue</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>The clue they left behind is a peculiar device: an alien Data-Tab. On first glance, it appears to be a smuggler&#39;s standard inventory and ledger tool, containing records of traded goods and transactions. But this one has a strange encryption, unlike anything commonly used in the human systems.</p>
<p>The Data-Tab was found hidden in one of the compartments of a suspicious space freighter docked at the Medina-99 station for routine inspection. Although the freighter seemed normal on the surface, the finding of the Data-Tab, and a small smuggled cargo of the psychoactive substances in an expertly hidden compartment, spurred the interest of our hero detectives.</p>
<p>This Data-Tab, once decrypted, will reveal a whole new depth to this smuggling operation, including communication from the accomplices, locations, times, and quantities of the shipments, and potential operation strategies. But it is not an easy task. The alien encryption is superior, and every attempt to access the stored information appears to risk wiping the device altogether. It will require the specific expertise to get the decrypted data without losing everything.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_30_plot (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_30_plot"><header><nav><h1>Plot</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_30_plot">Plot</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>Clue 2: Increase in Alien Technology</strong>
As the smuggling operations expand, more and more alien technology starts popping up in the marketplace. Some of these items, while seemingly harmless, have unique properties or rare components that aren&#39;t known to commonly be available in Medina-99. This influx of alien technology could point investigators towards broader operations involving alien criminals.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 3: The Uncommon Psychoactive Substances</strong>
These substances are not native to the Sol system, providing another clue to the players about the extent of the smuggling operation. Local law enforcement and medical professionals begin to report cases of citizens affected by this alien substance in strange ways --based on symptoms, this is clearly not a common Earth-origin drug.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 4: Zukor&#39;s Misdirection</strong>
If the players pay attention, they might notice a pattern in Zukor&#39;s investigations always leading away from where the action is. While Zukor is genuinely trying to solve the cases, his dogged pursuit of incomplete leads is questionable. The heroes might start investigating why he&#39;s always leading them astray.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 5: Increase in Intimidation and Obscure Threats</strong>
As Graxx and Klynn push to maintain control over their operation, there will be an uptick in obscure threats and intimidation against potential competitors and anyone who gets too close to the truth. This shows in increased &#39;accidental&#39; systems failures, threats disguised as freak accidents to those snooping too close, and a general atmosphere of fear among those in the know.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if the players are observant, they will be led to unravel the complex web of this smuggling operation and reveal the major players behind it.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_30_plot --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./20_clue.html">Previous: Clue</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Next: Interested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_40_interested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_40_interested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Interested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_40_interested_parties">Interested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>Party 1: Astra Corporation</strong>
Astra Corporation is a powerful and influential entity within the interstellar commercial sector. Their interests lie in maintaining their dominance in the market. The influx of illegal substances and alien technologies is creating an instability that they do not appreciate. Unafraid to get their hands dirty, they may leverage their vast financial and technological resources to interfere, becoming an unexpected ally, or a roadblock to the heroes, depending on their own corporate interests.</p>
<p><strong>Party 2: Commandant Rashida Vega</strong>
Commandant Vega heads the Security Department at the Medina-99 station. She has taken note of the rise in mysterious incidents and alien drug-related issues. Determined to maintain peace and order, she might be interested in forming an alliance with the detectives or might demand they hand over their investigations to her department, causing bureaucratic headaches for them.</p>
<p><strong>Party 3: The Pyxis Outfit</strong>
A rival smuggling cartel, the Pyxis outfit, is also interested in the rising tide of alien narcotics in Medina-99. Recognizing the foreign artifact as an unfamiliar alien cartel&#39;s signature, they might either attempt to muscle in on the operation or try to identify and eliminate the competition. They can just as easily be a hindrance or a lead depending on how the players interact with them.</p>
<p><strong>Party 4: Endangered Alien Species</strong>
The alien species that the harvesting of the psychoactive substance is affecting. Not many outside the cartel are aware, but the substances that Graxx smuggles originates from a sentient flora on an alien world - a fact that would enrage galactic environmentalists and the sentient flora&#39;s protectors. If this information ever got out, it could cause massive public relations and legal issues for Graxx and his cartel.</p>
<p><strong>Party 5: Independent Investigative Journalist</strong>
A journalism entity, possibly in the form of an independent investigative journalist or an avant-garde news network has also taken an interest in the unusual disturbances on the station. They might pursue leads aggressively, possibly getting into the way of both the criminals and the investigators, or they could be a source of information and public awareness. Depending on how the players frame their own investigation, this entity can either be a partner in their investigation or a nuisance revealing details prematurely.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_40_interested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Previous: Plot</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Next: Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_50_uninterested_parties (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_50_uninterested_parties"><header><nav><h1>Uninterested Parties</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_50_uninterested_parties">Uninterested Parties</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p><strong>Party 1: Dr. Elaina Hawthorne</strong> (Level – Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Smarts, +1 Skill (Analysis), Aspect – “Brilliant Xenobiologist”)
Dr. Hawthorne is a xenobiologist stationed at Medina-99. She has extensive knowledge about alien species and technologies, and could therefore help decrypt the alien Data-Tab or analyze the unique psychoactive substances. While she is primarily focused on her research and doesn’t concern herself with station politics or criminal activities, she does value scientific discovery and could be convinced to help in the name of further knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Party 2: Enzo &#39;Ziggy&#39; Zanetti</strong> (Level - Sergeant, Attributes - +1 Good (Technology), Aspect - &quot;Reclusive Technowizard&quot;)
Ziggy is an eccentric recluse who lives in one of the quieter sectors of the Medina-99 station, known for being a genius with anything tech-related. His skills and knowledge could be very useful in solving the mystery of the Data-Tab and any other technological clues the players might come across. Ziggy doesn&#39;t care for politics or crime, but he has a soft spot for a technical challenge and could be persuaded to lend his expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Party 3: Commander Assil Lohar</strong> (Level – Captain, Attributes - +2 Cool, +1 Grit, Aspects - &quot;Stoic Spacer, Experienced Negotiator&quot;)
Commander Lohar is a highly respected figure in the interstellar ships&#39; docking and freight management. He has a wide range of real-time information about ships coming in and out of the station and their cargo. He has his hands full just making sure the station operates smoothly, but if the crime became a threat to logistics, he might be persuaded to help, or at least provide useful information.</p>
<p><strong>Party 4: Astera Guild of Artificers</strong> (Level – General, Attributes - +2 Skill (Analysis), +2 Smarts, Aspects - &quot;Guardians of Ancient Knowledge, Mysterious and Neutral&quot;)
The Astera Guild is an organization of artisans, inventors, and researchers with vast knowledge of both ancient and cutting-edge technology. They are disinterested in mundane crimes, but the unusual technology associated with the alien drug might intrigue them. They could be a valuable resource, providing important information or analysis to the players. Their help won&#39;t come easily though, the players would need to negotiate or trade something of equal value.</p>
<p><strong>Party 5: Brother Levik</strong> (Level - Lieutenant, Attributes - +1 Cool, +1 Skill (Investigation), Aspect - &quot;Wise Old Bartender&quot;)
Brother Levik runs &quot;Levik&#39;s Last Light,&quot; a popular watering hole on Medina-99, where people from all walks of life come to unwind. Levik has a knack for listening and has an ear to the pulse of the station, he knows all the local rumors and gossip. Levik might not want to get involved, but with his access to station gossip and rumours, he might provide the players with invaluable insights indirectly.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_50_uninterested_parties --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./40_interested_parties.html">Previous: Interested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./60_title.html">Next: Title</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_60_title (links: hash) --><article id="_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_60_title"><header><nav><h1>Title</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_40_adventures">Adventures</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler">Sergeant Graxx Smuggler</a></li><li><a href="#_40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_60_title">Title</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>&quot;The Ring of Shadows: Deception at Medina-99.&quot;</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_60_title --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./50_uninterested_parties.html">Previous: Uninterested Parties</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="../20_mistress_zephira_cyper_criminal/index.html">Next: Mistress Zephira Cyper Criminal</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="../11_nubby_stout/90_journal.html">Previous: Journal</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Next: Accomplices And Plan</a></li></ol></nav></footer></section></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
