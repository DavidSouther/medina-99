On first glance, it appears to be a smuggler&#39;s standard inventory and ledger tool, containing records of traded goods and transactions. But this one has a strange encryption, unlike anything commonly used in the human systems.</p>
<p>The Data-Tab was found hidden in one of the compartments of a suspicious space freighter docked at the Medina-99 station for routine inspection. Although the freighter seemed normal on the surface, the finding of the Data-Tab, and a small smuggled cargo of the psychoactive substances in an expertly hidden compartment, spurred the interest of our hero detectives.</p>
<p>This Data-Tab, once decrypted, will reveal a whole new depth to this smuggling operation, including communication from the accomplices, locations, times, and quantities of the shipments, and potential operation strategies. But it is not an easy task. The alien encryption is superior, and every attempt to access the stored information appears to risk wiping the device altogether. It will require the specific expertise to get the decrypted data without losing everything.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _40_adventures_12_sergeant_graxx_smuggler_20_clue --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_accomplices_and_plan.html">Previous: Accomplices And Plan</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_plot.html">Next: Plot</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>Â©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
