Astra Corporation is a powerful and influential entity within the interstellar commercial sector. Their interests lie in maintaining their dominance in the market. The influx of illegal substances and alien technologies is creating an instability that they do not appreciate. Unafraid to get their hands dirty, they may leverage their vast financial and technological resources to interfere, becoming an unexpected ally, or a roadblock to the heroes, depending on their own corporate interests.</p>
<p><strong>Party 2: Commandant Rashida Vega</strong>
Commandant Vega heads the Security Department at the Medina-99 station. She has taken note of the rise in mysterious incidents and alien drug-related issues. Determined to maintain peace and order, she might be interested in forming an alliance with the detectives or might demand they hand over their investigations to her department, causing bureaucratic headaches for them.</p>
<p><strong>Party 3: The Pyxis Outfit</strong>
A rival smuggling cartel, the Pyxis outfit, is also interested in the rising tide of alien narcotics in Medina-99. Recognizing the foreign artifact as an unfamiliar alien cartel&#39;s signature, they might either attempt to muscle in on the operation or try to identify and eliminate the competition. They can just as easily be a hindrance or a lead depending on how the players interact with them.</p>
<p><strong>Party 4: Endangered Alien Species</strong>
The alien species that the harvesting of the psychoactive substance is affecting. Not many outside the cartel are aware, but the substances that Graxx smuggles originates from a sentient flora on an alien world - a fact that would enrage galactic environmentalists and the sentient flora&#39;s protectors. If this information ever got out, it could cause massive public relations and legal issues for Graxx and his cartel.</p>
<p><strong>Party 5: Independent Investigative Journalist</strong>
A journalism entity, possibly in the form of an independent investigative journalist or an avant-garde news network has also taken an interest in the unusual disturbances on the station. They might pursue leads aggressively, possibly getting into the way of both the criminals and the investigators, or they could be a source of information and public awareness. Depending on how the players frame their own investigation, this entity can either be a partner in their investigation or a nuisance revealing details prematurely.</p></main></article></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>©2023 David Souther</nav></footer><script src="https://unpkg.com/@davidsouther/jiffies-css/accessibility.js"></script></body></html>
