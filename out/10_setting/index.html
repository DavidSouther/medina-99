It orbits the sun, at the same distance as earth, about 10 degrees ahead of Earth in its orbit. Transfer stations are massive structures which coordinate transferring goods and passengers from deep-space, warp capable vessels to in-system torch ships. Warp vessels cannot engage warp while in systems, as there&#39;s too much concentrated mass, so they exit warp at the outskirts of systems and use their rocket propulsion to approach the stations. Then the subluminal ships move that around the system.</p>
<p>Grell-I-10 Transfer Station is one of these. Home to half a million full time residents and tens of thousands of passers-through, its cavernous main docks accommodate any size of transport vehicle.
The station has a central cylindrical zero-gravity section. At the two ends of these are those cavernous main docs, open to space.
They have quick access docks on the exterior and numerous dry-docks and pressurized docs on the inside of the cylinder.
These two main docks are connected by a narrower (but still very large) transport and mechanical system.
The center bulges out containing the station&#39;s main fusion reactor and water processing complex.
Radiating out from the main cylinder are a pair of counter-rotating habitation rings.
These rings are connected to the central shaft by three narrow elevator arms. At the base of each elevator arm is a zero-g aquaponics &amp; hydroponics food growth area.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _10_setting --><nav><ol><li></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./10_overview.html">Next: Overview</a></li></ol></nav></footer></section></main><footer class="fluid"><nav>Â©2023 David Souther</nav></footer></body></html>
