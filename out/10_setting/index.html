It orbits the sun, at the same distance as earth, about 10 degrees ahead of Earth in its orbit. Transfer stations are massive structures which coordinate transferring goods and passengers from deep-space, warp capable vessels to in-system torch ships. Warp vessels cannot engage warp while in systems, as there&#39;s too much concentrated mass, so they exit warp at the outskirts of systems and use their rocket propulsion to approach the stations. Then the subluminal ships move that around the system.</p>
<p>Grell-I-10 Transfer Station is one of these. Home to half a million full time residents and tens of thousands of passers-through, its cavernous main docks accommodate any size of transport vehicle.
The station has a central cylindrical zero-gravity section. At the two ends of these are those cavernous main docs, open to space.
They have quick access docks on the exterior and numerous dry-docks and pressurized docs on the inside of the cylinder.
These two main docks are connected by a narrower (but still very large) transport and mechanical system.
The center bulges out containing the station&#39;s main fusion reactor and water processing complex.
Radiating out from the main cylinder are a pair of counter-rotating habitation rings.
These rings are connected to the central shaft by three narrow elevator arms. At the base of each elevator arm is a zero-g aquaponics &amp; hydroponics food growth area.</p></main><!-- Section _10_setting_10_overview (links: hash) --><article id="_10_setting_10_overview"><header><nav><h1>Overview</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_10_setting">Setting</a></li><li><a href="#_10_setting_10_overview">Overview</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>The Grell-I-10 Transfer Station, which orbits the sun roughly 10 degrees ahead of Earth, is an intricate complex built for interstellar transfers. Its location allows it to be a hub for deep-space vessels, which transition their goods and passengers to in-system torch ships there. </p>
<p>The Station itself is akin to a small city in space, housing around a half-million full-time residents, with a revolving door of tens of thousands transient passersby. Its sizeable structure makes it possible to accommodate any class of vehicle. Two main docks, open to space, lie at the ends of a central cylindrical zero-gravity section. These well-designed docking points consist of both quick access docks on the exterior and numerous dry-docks and pressurized docks on the inside of the cylinder. </p>
<p>Connecting these two docks is a narrow, yet significant, transport and mechanical system. A heavy-duty fusion reactor and a water processing complex sprout out from the center of this system. At the base of each elevator arm in this region, one can find a zero-g aquaponics &amp; hydroponics food growth section essential for the station&#39;s sustenance. </p>
<p>Bordering the central section are two counter-rotating habitation rings. These segments form the residential areas of the station. Each ring, teeming with life and activity, links to the central shaft via three narrow elevator arms. Throughout the station, pockets of life thrive away from earth amidst cold, infinite space, each corner bustling with its distinctive routine, making the station a sprawling cosmos of its own. </p>
<p>The tone of life here is mostly light-hearted, especially in the Medina ring, which is quite suburban in character. The inhabitants, including our detective heroes, experience moments of hilarity, danger, and everything in between as they navigate their lives in this bustling station.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _10_setting_10_overview --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./index.html">Previous: Setting</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./20_docks.html">Next: Docks</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _10_setting_20_docks (links: hash) --><article id="_10_setting_20_docks"><header><nav><h1>Docks</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_10_setting">Setting</a></li><li><a href="#_10_setting_20_docks">Docks</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>The two main docks of the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station serve as its lifelines, allowing a seamless flux of traffic from across the universe. Eternally open to the inky expanse of space, these docks are an avatar of constant activity and regimented chaos. Both docks are covered by massive translucent force-fields, allowing ships in and out while maintaining the station&#39;s inner atmosphere – a marvel of engineering and quantum physics.</p>
<p>Ship Dock Alpha, the so-called &quot;Gateway of Grell,&quot; is the primary dock, welcoming a staggering array of vehicles, from tiny personal craft to gargantuan haulers. Massive neon guidance lights line its approach, drawing pilots in like moths to a flame. Further in, the dock becomes less glamorous and more industrial.

Dry-docks are filled with various ship types, scaffolding, and teams of engineers in spacesuits, wielding plasma torches surrounded by a haze of metal particles. The sounds here are gruff, metallic, and hot. There&#39;s a sense of dedication and sweat of honest labor.</p>
<p>Near the center of Alpha, you&#39;ll find Dock Zero, a small, pressurized dock used for high-priority, sensitive departures, and arrivals. Dock Zero, outfitted with additional security protocols, is where diplomats, high-ranking military officers, and important clients choose to dock. The atmosphere is subdued, echoes of hushed conversations bounce off the gleaming, polished metal walls.</p>
<p>Across the station in Dock Beta, the Greenhouse Dock has carved a niche. Instead of hosting ships or freight, the Greenhouse Dock serves as an experimental botany lab where new plants brought back from other worlds are studied and cultivated. Unearthly flora fills the air with strange, exotic scents. This dock, always bathed in an artificial but natural-feeling sunlight, provides a sense of peace and serenity amidst the industrial bustle of the station.</p></main><footer><!-- SectionNav for _10_setting_20_docks --><nav><ol><li><!-- Section Previous Link --><a href="./10_overview.html">Previous: Overview</a></li><li><!-- Section Next Link --><a href="./30_ring.html">Next: Ring</a></li></ol></nav></footer></article><!-- Section _10_setting_30_ring (links: hash) --><article id="_10_setting_30_ring"><header><nav><h1>Ring</h1><!-- Breadcrumbs --><ol class="breadcrumbs"><li><a href="#_10_setting">Setting</a></li><li><a href="#_10_setting_30_ring">Ring</a></li></ol><a href="#">Top</a></nav></header><main><p>The counter-rotating habitation rings of the Grell-I-10 Transfer Station house the bustling residential life of the station.
