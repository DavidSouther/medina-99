**Analytical:** This approach describes a detective who takes their time to assess situations, analyze clues, and come to well-thought-out conclusions. They would be the ones to thoroughly scan a spaceship for anomalies or patiently stake out a spaceport for suspicious activities.
**Assertive:** Detectives using this approach are bold, direct, and confrontational. They won't hesitate to confront a notorious space pirate head-on or to forcefully interrogate a suspect.
**Charismatic:** Detectives with this approach use their charm, wit, and flair to get the job done. They might dazzle an alien council with their eloquence or charm their way into restricted areas of a space station.
**Quick:** This is for detectives who rely on their speed, reflexes, and quick thinking. They might dodge laser blasts, chase down space criminals through asteroid fields, or quickly piece together a puzzle before a bomb detonates.
**Subtle:** This approach is for detectives who prefer to operate from the shadows, gather information without being noticed, and use subterfuge. They might infiltrate an alien mafia undetected or discreetly gather intel at a high-stakes space gala.
**Technological:** This approach represents a detective who uses advanced tech, gadgets, and innovative methods to solve cases. They could hack into a spaceship's mainframe, decipher alien codes, or use tech-based methods to gather information.
