  Provide several locations and their flavor text in the Medina 99 sector. The
  medina 99 sector is home to the precinct house for our heroes, and is the
  ringside terminus of one of the transit spokes.

1. The Luminous Lantern Café: The café is a hotspot for delicious alien cuisines, interstellar drinks, and cozy conversation. It's located near the transit spoke's terminus, making it a convenient stop for anyone just finishing their intra-station commute. The windows of the café look out onto the glimmering self-contained horizon of the Medina Ring, giving patrons a view to remember. Its unique charm comes from the soft glow of alien minerals they use for ambient lighting, hence the café's name.

2. The Precinct House, Medina 99: The precinct house functions as the heart of law and order in the Medina Ring. Nestled between a row of residential buildings and a small park, it houses our heroic detectives. The exterior is deceptively simple, showcasing a sleek design with an emblem of authority. Inside, it's a hive of activity, filled with officers, detectives, and support staff. Holo-displays periodically flash crime stats, safety tips, and inspiring messages about order and justice. 

3. The Spoke Station M99: This is the last stop of the transport line connecting to the central shaft. It's a bustling hub of activity at peak hours, with people departing and arriving in streams. The round-the-clock hum of activity blends with dinging announcements, the hiss of the airlock doors, and subdued chatter of commuters. Around the station, small vendors hawk snacks, trinkets, and newspapers from across the galaxy.

4. Stellar Park: This community park is a breath of fresh space air, located a hop and a skip from the precinct house. Despite being indoors, it replicates a sunny day under open skies, complete with holographic birds fluttering overhead. Board paths wind through artificially cultivated grass and over babbling blue streams. A wide-open space in the center of the park often holds community events, from charity runs to music concerts. 

5. The Heritage Museum: The museum is a point of pride for Medina 99, educating residents about humanity's cosmic journey. From the first space flight to the creation of their home, Grell-I-10, each exhibit uses captured holograms, artefacts and interactive panels to bring history alive. The museum, with its tall glass facade, stands elegantly near the central park, inviting passersby to take a glance into our past as we stride towards the future.
